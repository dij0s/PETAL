    "This image is part of a document discussing solar installations in Switzerland, specifically focusing on the irradiation levels across the country. It includes a map titled \"Irradiation globale horizontale\" (Global Horizontal Irradiation) for Switzerland, showing the average annual solar radiation in kilowatt-hours per square meter (kWh/m²). The map uses color coding to represent different irradiation levels, with darker shades indicating higher irradiation values. The legend at the bottom indicates that the lowest irradiation level is less than 1000 kWh/m² and the highest is over 1400 kWh/m².\n\nThe document outlines the priorities for installing solar panels in Switzerland, emphasizing that solar installations cannot be prohibited if they meet certain legal criteria (e.g., cantonal construction regulations and administrative requirements). The priorities for solar installations are as follows:\n\n- **Priority 1:** Solar installations on buildings or infrastructure:\n  - On buildings in building zones or agricultural zones;\n  - On buildings outside building zones and outside agricultural zones;\n  - On infrastructure (e.g., slope stabilization, avalanche protection, noise barriers, hydroelectric dam walls).\n\n- **Priority 2:** Solar installations outside buildings or infrastructure:\n  - In building zones (e.g., gardens, meadows, lawns);\n  - Outside building zones (e.g., material extraction and storage areas, agricultural zones, protected areas).\n\nThe document also mentions that local electricity distribution companies and municipalities play an active role in this development by focusing on large roofs. Another objective is to increase the mastery of activities in the solar energy value chain by public authorities and other Valaisan actors (e.g., energy distribution companies, other businesses, pension funds, private entities). Rapid growth in photovoltaic energy is maintained primarily in the hands of local communities and enterprises, which will effectively increase the share of Valaisan hands to cover the canton's electricity needs before the return of hydraulic concessions."

    "### E.5 Solar Installations\n\n#### Priority 3: Large Isolated Solar Installations\nIn the last resort, large isolated solar installations can be installed on particularly suitable sites. According to Article 8 al. 2 of the Federal Law on Territorial Development (LAT), projects that have significant impacts on the territory and the environment must have been foreseen in the master plan. However, they still require strict cantonal coordination rules presented in the section \"Conditions to respect for coordinated regulation.\"\n\nThese projects are considered significant impacts on the territory due to major effects or encroachments on land use and equipment, divergent interests regarding land use, significant transport flows, and the generation of heavy traffic, as well as considerable sources of emissions and high environmental burdens (e.g., air, noise, landscape, natural habitats).\n\nThe cantonal objective of solar electricity production cannot be achieved without considering the impacts on transportation networks and electricity distribution systems, as well as storage possibilities. Solar project planning in Valais thus requires coordination on economic, environmental, and spatial levels.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n1. Prioritize the installation of solar panels on buildings, while ensuring no major impact on cantonally or nationally important cultural assets or natural sites (Article 18a al. 3 LAT and 32b of the Territorial Development Ordinance (OAT)).\n2. Examine during all roof, facade, or new construction renovation works the opportunity to install solar panels.\n3. Adapt solar installations to buildings by combining technical solutions with natural conditions (e.g., sunlight exposure, altitude, orientation).\n4. Ensure that solar installations of less than 10,000 m² installed outside buildings or on infrastructure do not have significant impacts on the territory.\n5. Consider large isolated solar installations only on particularly suitable sites from an energy perspective, offering very favorable conditions and generating low environmental, natural, and landscape impacts.\n6. Require, for isolated solar installations, the detailed development plan instrument (PAD, Article 12 of the Cantonal Law of Application of the Federal Law on Territorial Development (LcAT)), accompanied by an environmental impact study (EIE) if the installed power exceeds 5 MW.\n\n#### Follow-Up Process\nThe canton:\na) updates its cantonal energy strategy for solar energy, specifying objectives to achieve and measures and resources to implement;\nb) defines a strategy aimed at equipping its own buildings and infrastructure with solar installations;\n"

Projects having significant effects on territorial organization and the environment are classified in the \"coordinated planning\" category when it is proven, within the coordination framework, that the project meets the following conditions:\n\nI. Local authorities of the site community support the project;\nII. The owners or landowners concerned by the project's implementation have given their consent;\nIII.

    "This document is part of a cantonal planning guide for the canton of VS (Vaud). It focuses on the quality of building zones and discusses strategies for sustainable territorial development. Here's a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n### Section C.2: Quality of Building Zones\n\n#### Appropriate Dimensioning of Building Zones\nProper dimensioning of building zones contributes to reversing negative trends. The Swiss Territorial Project has set objectives and determined strategies for sustainable territorial development. One of these strategies aims to enhance the built environment and landscapes by ensuring moderate land use and qualitative densification of the built environment. By considering landscapes early in planning, it is possible to simultaneously promote regional diversity and urban space quality.\n\n#### Article 8a al. 1 of the Federal Law on Territorial Planning (LAT)\nThis article specifies that the urbanization plan should define how to concentrate high-quality urbanization within the built environment and reinforce urban renewal.\n\n#### Densification of the Built Environment\nDensification of the built environment should occur in appropriate locations, particularly in urban areas or central villages offering good employment, commerce, services, and public transport access. It is also advisable to favor economic construction methods in rural areas.\n\n#### Considerations for Densification\nPerformance of service provision, capacity of existing infrastructure and equipment absorption, and overall operation costs must be considered during densification processes.\n\n#### Quality of Urban Life\nIt is important that development within the built environment aligns with a quality of life framework. This includes considering the urban context (e.g., location and building characteristics) and national importance sites (ISOS) that need protection. It also involves adhering to noise protection norms.\n\n#### Public Space\nPublic space should be designed to accommodate multiple functions: transit mobility, soft transportation, encounters (e.g., benches, play areas), commerce (e.g., restaurant terraces, cafes), markets, events, etc. It should be accessible to all users (e.g., people with reduced mobility, children) and safe.\n\n#### Public Space Quality\nThe quality of public space can encourage residents to undertake urban renewal projects.\n\n#### Urban Fabric Permeability\nUrban fabric permeability enhances the quality of life for both residents and users. Creating a network of soft mobility reduces distances between residential, work, and leisure locations, thereby reducing the impact of mobility on the environment, air pollution, and noise nuisance. This quality of life is achieved through good public transport access and improved transit traffic policy (quality crossing arrangements"

    "### C.2 Building Zone Quality\n\nCoordinated the various functions (habitat, mobility, employment, supply, leisure) to improve mobility and reduce traffic impacts by favoring alternative modes of transport (e.g., public transportation, soft mobility). Regarding public spaces, they must be designed to structure urbanization and create meeting places.\n\nIn the communes of the hilly and valley areas, development towards the interior allows limiting the spread of buildings that devalue the landscape and night to the attractiveness of these spaces, both for residents and tourists, and thus for economic development. This densification also brings life back to the heart of certain localities facing depopulation of their center. Historic village centers distinguished by traditional architecture must be valued and revitalized at the urban, architectural, and functional levels, notably through rehabilitation and renovation of buildings, and by public space design emphasizing architectural and landscape heritage.\n\nAn affordable housing offer for all segments of the population contributes to the long-term attractiveness of a commune and the proper functioning of local associative and social life, especially thanks to intergenerational mixity. In tourist communes, the local population should also have access to acceptable living conditions.\n\nWithin the framework of the cantonal regional policy, an aid to housing may also be granted in zones presenting specific problems related to mountainous and rural areas, according to the regional policy law ordinance.\n\n\\section*{Coordination}\n\n\\subsection*{Principles}\n\n1. Develop urbanization towards the interior and densify in appropriate places, respecting the traditional structure of urbanization, existing built heritage (notably ISOS), and the quality of life, if necessary through the definition of a development perimeter.\n2. Encourage high-quality urbanization and architecture in urban, rural, and tourist areas.\n3. Promote functional, social, and intergenerational mixity in neighborhoods and promote the availability of affordable housing.\n4. Design public spaces (e.g., streets, squares, parks) to favor multifunctional use and ensure their safety and conviviality.\n5. Preserve and value architectural, urbanistic, cultural, and landscape heritage, notably through urban renewal operations and adequate public space design.\n6. Revitalize and dynamize historic village centers, both from an urban and functional point of view.\n7. Coordinate urbanization development with public transport provision and promote soft mobility.\n8. Maintain and reinforce the presence of nature and biodiversity in the city, notably through urban greenery.\n9. Encourage urban structures that"

    "### D.5 Daily Sustainable Mobility (MDQ)\n\nThe federal transport policy aims to better meet current and future mobility needs while respecting the environment. Thus, MDQ represents a significant potential for improving the transport system, promoting non-polluting mobility, and stimulating public health. This is why Switzerland's transport policy has been encouraging MDQ, whether individually or in combination with another mode of transport, for several years. In this context, the Confederation supports cantons in developing directives, conducting basic research, and financially contributing to the development of MDQ infrastructure within agglomeration projects.\n\nNotably, due to favorable conditions in the plain, there has been a renewal of walking and cycling over the past few years. This change is hindered by urban and road structures heavily influenced by decades of automobile-oriented development, as well as habits and a demand for individual motorized transport (TIM) strongly pronounced in Valais. Even though MDQ cannot be developed everywhere due to topographical and economic constraints, recent examples of successful MDQ development have shown its important role, whether environmentally, economically, in public health, or socially.\n\nAt the cantonal level, in order to support the practice of MDQ, as analyzed in the Canton's Mobility 2040 Concept, the main challenge is to develop the MDQ network within agglomerations and between localities in the plain, as well as in tourist centers where modal transfer potential exists. In the Rhône plain, favorable topographical conditions make MDQ a significant means of transport. However, general cycling route networks and parking spaces for bicycles at multimodal interfaces remain lacking. An important challenge is also to avoid conflicts and identify and highlight synergies between MDQ and MDL by coordinating corresponding strategies and plans.\n\nUltimately, the low share of MDQ in Valais can partly be explained by unfavorable topographical conditions in the side valleys; it is essential to improve MDQ networks and infrastructures, with the objective that the street becomes a convivial space for everyone and that MDQ complements public transport (TP) and TIM, thus constituting one of the three pillars of multimodal mobility.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n1. Ensure the continuity of MDQ networks, link them together, and promote synergies with MDL routes and the needs of people with reduced mobility.\n2. Optimize networks, particularly by avoiding detours and elevation changes.\n3. Improve infrastructure and their attractiveness, especially by ensuring accessibility and the availability of"

    "### C.5 Agglomerations\n\n#### Continuity\nThese strong links, between plain and mountain, should be valued in favor of the rural space traversed (e.g., extensive tourism, economic activities, accommodation).\n\nThe diversity of the Valais canton, which combines the advantages of the city and the countryside, should be valorized. Rural village centers offer a multitude of possibilities in many areas: economy, culture, landscape, urbanization, leisure, habitat, work, services, and infrastructure. On the slopes and in the side valleys, a rebalancing is possible with the overburdened urban centers. This \"decentralization\" desired by urbanization and the installation of infrastructures intended for the population and tourists would allow the maintenance of populations in the rural space and limit mobility.\n\nThe necessary coherence between urbanization and transport must also take into account the landscape. Without this coordination, what was initially intended to protect would disappear with attention to each project.\n\nThe non-built spaces between the centers, which it is advisable to conserve, play a very important function for agriculture, the landscape, or tourism, relaxation, and leisure.\n\n#### Coordination\n\n##### Principles\n1. Maintain and reinforce the quality of life and the economic attractiveness of agglomerations.\n2. Promote the emergence of a common vision of sustainable development of the built environment, transport, landscape, and energy supply.\n3. Strengthen intercommunal, intercantonial, and international connections of agglomerations.\n4. Solve the problems of urbanization, transport, and landscape that cannot be resolved at the intercommunal scale.\n5. Ensure a high-quality urbanization and public spaces in the urban environment.\n6. Network agglomerations and valorize their link with tourist centers in the traversed rural space.\n7. Maintain non-built spaces between agglomerations and limit the extension of urbanization.\n\n##### Actions to Follow\n**The canton:**\na) actively contributes to the elaboration of agglomeration projects;\nb) supports the implementation of measures related to agglomeration projects;\nc) oversees the planning and financing of regional and urban traffic infrastructure serving agglomerations within its competence;\nd) signs, with the Confederation, the agreement concerning the services related to agglomeration projects;\ne) signs, with the communes, the complementary agreement to the corresponding service agreement.\n\n**The communes:**\na) develop agglomeration projects;\nb) implement"

    "### B.1 Tourism integrated\n\nThe tourism policy 2016 is based on authentic values and respect for nature and the environment, encouraging the transition from tourism construction to tourism exploitation. The Valaisan tourism industry has a great need for adaptation to overcome current structural challenges. However, qualitative growth must take precedence over quantitative growth.\n\nA development aiming for ambition must be supraregional, national, and even international, transcending municipal borders to meet client expectations. Common vision and planning are two prerequisites for developing a competitive offer while accelerating subsequent procedures. Tourism is a sector characterized by cross-sectoral policies, such as agricultural, territorial, or environmental policies.\n\nThe prosperity of mountain tourism is only possible through year-round exploitation. Thus, a shift towards a diversified and integrated offer is necessary. The entire infrastructure developed for winter tourism must also be considered in the summer perspective. Agriculture-tourism plays a crucial role in maintaining mountain regions as vital economic spaces. This tourism development should not serve only tourists but the entire Valais population.\n\nNew constructions, installations, and infrastructures must improve their aesthetic quality but also integrate into the landscape, including neighboring villages, to enhance foreign guests' stay like residents in the Alpine space. The quality and attractiveness of our destinations also depend on mastering secondary residence construction and heating of beds (specific theme addressed in the lodging tourism file).\n\nInfrastructures allowing easy access to large Alpine centers also provide complementary offers in urban centers. This link reinforced between plain and mountain is to generate new activities within the rural space traversed and create innovative offers. Thus, all regions benefit in the long term from the positive effects induced by development.\n\n\\section*{Coordination}\n\n\\subsection*{Principles}\n\n1. Promote an integrated tourism based on a balance between intensive and extensive tourism.\n2. Highlight traditional, natural, and cultural landscapes.\n3. Rebalance tourist seasons by strengthening summer offerings and developing four-season tourism.\n4. Diversify the tourism offer and highlight existing cross-sectoral offers by reinforcing the complementarity between destinations and tourist spaces, rural and urban.\n5. Preserve and restore the traditional built environment as a basic tourist capital, mastering secondary residence construction, and maintaining indigenous populations.\n6. Orient future investments toward synergies in the use of tourism and transport infrastructure throughout the year.\n7. Promote forms of extensive tourism that strive to accommodate nature (leisure mobility routes: e.g., VTT in summer, cross-country skiing or ski touring in winter).\n\n"

Natural or artificial obstacles, such as water courses, communication routes, urbanized zones, or other impassable structures, hinder the movement of certain faunal species or the dispersal of certain floral species, leading to the isolation of these populations. However, the long-term survival of viable and functional populations depends on their ability to ensure regular genetic mixing, which is only possible if they are in contact. Therefore, the creation of an ecological network favoring interconnection between vital spaces is a priority.\n\nAn ecological network consists of priority vital spaces for biodiversity, connected by corridors or biological links. The ecological network is articulated around different objects, classified by categories according to the Cantonal Ecological Network Director Concept for the Rhône Plain (REC):\n- **Nodal zone**: sector where main species or ecosystems are present and where their vital conditions are met;\n- **Relay zone**: natural or artificial space playing an important role as refuge and temporary habitat, especially for moving fauna;\n- **Continuum**: adjacent environments not directly exploitable as habitat but ensuring species movement;\n- **Buffer zones**: areas aiming to protect a nodal zone from the"

    "### A.11 Ecological Networks and Fauna Corridors\n\nMaintaining and recreating essential ecological networks for exchanges is one of the major challenges for nature protection. To establish a functional ecological network, coordination with activities affecting territorial organization is necessary, particularly urbanization and transport infrastructure, agriculture and forestry, water management, tourism and leisure, hunting, and fishing.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n1. Preserve, restore, and strengthen the ecological connectivity of habitats of great value and important faunistic corridors.\n2. Consider ecological networks and fauna corridors in infrastructure and urban planning projects to avoid habitat fragmentation.\n3. Facilitate animal movements through specific measures aimed at making dispersal obstacles permeable, by restoring relay biotopes or construction measures (e.g., fish passage, wildlife crossing).\n4. Integrate surfaces promoting biodiversity (SPB) within agricultural policy and encourage agriculture respectful of natural environments.\n5. Revitalize watercourses to allow species movement.\n\n#### Actions to Follow\n**The canton:**\na) Takes into account the objectives, applies study measures concerning different ecological networks in its planning tasks, and updates the REC with neighboring cantons and countries;\nb) Supports, in collaboration with municipalities, RER projects;\nc) Defines priority areas for biodiversity promotion in agricultural surfaces, depending on rare or protected species needs;\nd) Develops, in collaboration with concerned municipalities, regional concepts of nature protection ensuring ecological links and balances;\ne) Sees to the integration of ecological networks, especially in the framework of river revitalization projects and wetland biotope developments with neighboring cantons and countries;\nf) Manages and revitalizes natural populations or forest reserves according to ecological network functionality parameters;\ng) Establishes contracts with landowners for the implementation of network integration measures in accordance with the direct payment ordinance (OPD);\nh) Takes into account aspects of animal mobility during infrastructure planning and existing traffic routes, and puts in place safety measures in accordance with accident zones and collisions with game;\ni) Plans and contributes to measures to prevent damages observed in agriculture and forestry in connection with the development of wildlife corridors, particularly overpasses.\n\n**The municipalities:**\na) Can integrate various ecological networks and fauna corridors into the appropriate municipal planning instrument;"

    "This document is part of a cantonal energy planning document for the canton of Valais, Switzerland. It discusses the transportation and distribution of energy, focusing on high-voltage transmission lines (THT) and regional distribution networks. Here's a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n### Section E.7: Transport et distribution d'énergie\n\n#### January 3, 2013 Transfer\nOn January 3, 2013, all THT lines in Switzerland were transferred to Swissgrid SA, which became the sole owner of the Swiss THT network. Swissgrid SA prepares multi-year plans and periodically updates a global strategic network plan. These actions are coordinated with the Confederation, cantons, network operators, CFF (Swiss Federal Railways), and producers.\n\n#### Insufficient Development of the Network\nThe THT network in Valais is insufficiently developed to absorb new production capacities. Current capacity must be increased and adapted according to needs. Several 220 kV lines, at their capacity limit, need to be replaced by 380 kV lines, notably the \"Chamoson-Chippis\" line, which is not included in the PSE (Plan Suisse d'Électricité).\n\n#### Regional Distribution Network (36-150 kV)\nThe regional distribution network (lines at high voltage/HT between 36 and 150 kV) is the second level of tension. It serves to feed pumping stations of hydroelectric installations in side valleys, local distribution networks, and large industrial enterprises. Its operation has been entrusted to the company \"Forces Motrices Valaisannes\" since 2011.\n\n#### Future Network Development\nThe 125 kV network will progressively be retired, decommissioned, or partially replaced by 380, 220, or 65 kV lines. The 65 kV network constitutes the Valais regional network. This network, where pylons represent a danger to wildlife, should be adapted or even buried.\n\n#### Local Distribution Networks (36-0.4 kV)\nThe two lower levels of tension are the regional distribution network (lines at medium voltage/MT 1 to 36 kV) and the local distribution network (lines at low voltage/BT 0.4 to 1 kV). The regional network, for the most part already buried, supplies distribution network managers and some"

    "### E.7 Energy Transport and Distribution\n\nIn the context of industrial ecology, it is desirable that municipalities plan their energy supply on their territory by favoring, in the appropriate areas, the construction of distant heat networks.\n\nDue to necessary investments, such a supply system is economically interesting primarily in zones having a high heat consumption density. The creation of a distant heat network and its connection to this last one are subsidized by the canton. By the end of 2017, the canton surveyed, without the networks for large industry, more than forty networks of CAD mainly fed by renewable energies and heat rejection.\n\n### Gas Network\n\nGas networks were strongly developed in Switzerland after the oil crisis of 1973. The reduction of dependence on mazut was the first argument for this development. The lower air pollution during combustion (nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, soot), followed by reduced CO2 emissions compared to mazut, allowed the gas industry to experience very strong growth over many years. Despite this, gas distribution represented only 14% of final energy consumption in Switzerland in 2016.\n\nThe gas distributed in Switzerland is almost exclusively fossil origin, although some biogas has been injected into the network since a few years ago. This biogas represented, in 2016, 1.5% of the distributed gas. The capacities of the Swiss network's transport system are sufficient to meet an increase in natural gas consumption. They also ensure the demand for gas resulting from the exploitation of three to five combined cycle power plants.\n\nThe Valais pipeline was historically built to feed the large industrial sites. The existence of this pipeline has allowed the development of fine distribution networks (< 5 bar). The distribution network, constantly expanding, supplies about forty flat and mountain localities. In Valais, gas represented, in 2015, 15% of energy consumption, without considering large industry. It covered 49% of the needs of large industry.\n\nGiven the ambitious energy and climate policy objectives at the federal level, the role of gas in energy supply is called to change: it will have to be reserved for processes requiring high temperatures (e.g., industrial processes, combined gas power plants, large heat-pump systems), and to meet the needs of buildings that cannot be supplied by renewable energies or connected to a distant heat network in a satisfactory manner. Gas could also play a supplementary role in feeding distant heat networks"

    "### E.7 Transport et distribution d'énergie\n\n#### Coordination\n\n##### Principes\n\n1. Optimize the integration of all Valaisan electrical networks into the national and international interconnected network, and increase the security of supply, particularly by improving the network grid.\n2. Ensure rational transport and distribution of energy within the canton while respecting the interests of the population, as well as the energy policy requirements, environmental protection, nature conservation, agriculture, groundwater, and built-up areas.\n3. Promote the planning of underground electrical networks, especially for high-voltage transmission lines (HVT), while respecting the non-ionizing radiation protection ordinance (art. 4 and ss. 13 and ss ORNI) and avoiding construction zones and public installations.\n4. Adapt the electricity transport and distribution network to the development of heat pumps, decentralized electricity production (e.g., hydroelectricity, photovoltaics, wind power, combined heat and power), and electric mobility.\n5. After technical feasibility analysis and consideration of all interests involved, favor underground cabling compared to overhead lines in the framework of electric transport infrastructure planning.\n6. Restrict land use by concentrating, as much as possible, electrical lines in technical corridors.\n7. Restructure, within the framework of network development, the electricity transport system by favoring the increase in capacity of existing lines and reducing the number of corridors, while ensuring network security.\n8. Promote the planning of distant heat networks within zones of sufficient energy density.\n9. Limit the extension and densification of the gas network to sectors that cannot be equipped with distant heat networks, as well as to sectors composed mainly of buildings whose thermal needs cannot be met by indigenous renewable energies and/or heat rejection.\n10. Coordinate gas and oil pipeline networks with human activity locations (e.g., housing, work, agricultural activities, education, recreation, and leisure) and with a view to preventing major accidents.\n\n##### Marche à suivre\n\nThe canton:\na) coordinates network planning by taking into account the instruments of other institutional levels, particularly the PSE, where it also values its interests during projects for HVT line construction;\nb) supports underground cabling within the framework of electric transport infrastructure planning, when technical and economic feasibility allows it, and all interests have been taken into account;\nc) encourages the creation of distant heat networks and connection to distant heating networks, prioritizing underground installation in agricultural and protected zones."

Their planning plays a crucial role in territorial economic, social, and environmental development. In a context of intercantonal and international competition, companies must have access to varied terrain offers adapted to their needs to form a competitive, diversified, and innovative economic fabric, thus maintaining and creating new jobs.\n\nMajor traffic generating installations (IGT) and public interest installations are treated in other cantonal director plan sheets (C.7 and C.8).\n\nEconomic activity zones are divided into industrial, artisanal, and mixed zones:\n- Industrial zones, generally of supra-communal importance, host high-value-added enterprises impacting territory organization. They offer good conditions for these enterprises to continue developing and synergies;\n- Artisanal zones, primarily of communal interest, accommodate local enterprises (artisan, small and medium-sized enterprises—PME) generating certain nuisances and cannot, therefore, be authorized in mixed or residential zones. They ensure decentralized occupation of the territory;\n- Mixed activity zones, of communal or supra-communal scope, are reserved for housing, tertiary activities (e.g., offices, services, commerce), and economic activities producing little nuisances."

    "### C.4 Economic Activity Zones\n\nThe canton has also identified cantonal zones of interest (Zones d'Activités d'Intérêt Cantonal, ZAIC), which correspond to sites considered priorities by the canton and play an economic stimulator role. These areas host various activities in the industrial, service, and Research & Development sectors, which can be coordinated with residential functions, possibly commercial ones. They have good road access and are well served by public transport. They are located around or near a station, presenting surfaces of at least 5 hectares and concentrating employment-intensive and high-value-added enterprises.\n\nArticle 30a al. 2 of the Territorial Planning Ordinance (OAT) requires the canton to establish a system for managing economic activities for the creation of new economic activity zones, particularly through the holding of a regional overview and, if necessary, inter-cantonal. The Swiss Territory Project, in its objective 4 (\"Enhance competitiveness\"), requests that the Confederation, cantons, cities, and municipalities create conditions favorable to a competitive and diversified economy by maintaining a polycentric network of cities and communes, reinforcing the specific advantages of different regions.\n\nThe Valaisan economic fabric is diversified and relies on several sectors of activity, with the most significant being industry, wholesale and retail trade, construction, health and social services, as well as accommodation and catering. It is characterized by a very large majority of micro-enterprises (91.1% of establishments) and small enterprises (7.8%), distributed across the territory and employing about 70% of active people (full-time equivalents). Medium and large enterprises are located mainly in the plain.\n\nThere is an increase in employment in secondary and tertiary sectors, but this last one is the only one to see its proportion increase. Compared to other western cantons of Switzerland, the Valais has not experienced growth in high-value-added sectors with a high potential for innovation.\n\nWith the Regional Policy Law of December 12, 2008 (LPR), the Valais canton wants to focus its economic development strategy on added-value systems, whether in the Rhône valley, tourist centers, or rural zones. The objective is to promote a diversified economic development that takes into account the specific needs of different regions and regional disparities, and to promote businesses in all types of spaces (decentralized occupation), so as to maintain the population throughout the territory and limit home"

    "### C.4 Economic Activity Zones\n\nThe availability of land is generally not guaranteed, despite significant land reserves. Only a relatively small portion of the land is in public hands.\n\nThe analysis of building zones shows that Valais has approximately 900 hectares of land reserved for economic activities (as of 2016), with the largest part located in the Lower Valais. The canton thus has sufficient land affected by economic activity zones to meet medium and long-term demand, although this offer is unevenly distributed across the territory. The priority is to use this reserve of land before creating new zones, unless specific regional needs are demonstrated (notably in the case of agglomeration projects).\n\nA global approach to economic activity zones is necessary to identify, within the current land offer, which sites are potentially favorable for accommodating new economic activities, depending on criteria such as available surface, accessibility, or enterprise mobility needs. This approach requires the establishment of intercommunal coordinations, possibly interregional, with the support of socio-economic regions as per the LPR.\n\nActive management of these zones is essential to ensure the availability and proper development of land for measured and appropriate use. Elements such as construction capacity, urbanization, service and equipment mutualization, or substitution synergies (industrial ecology) should be considered during zone implementation. Urban quality and architecture, as well as integration into the landscape and neighboring areas, should also be prioritized.\n\nIn the objective of rational land use, it is necessary to maintain and reinforce the mix between residential and economic activities in towns and villages, particularly near public transport hubs.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n\n1. Manage economic activity zones actively to ensure the availability of land (reserves and industrial wastelands) and their optimal use according to their vocation and economic promotion needs.\n2. Value cantonal economic activity zones, develop high-value-added economic sectors, improve their accessibility, especially in public transport and through daily sustainable mobility, and ensure their extension based on justified need, with compensation if necessary.\n3. Favor the planning of intercommunal economic activity zones while allowing the maintenance and development of communal economic activity zones when justified by existing activities.\n4. Optimize the occupation of economic activity zones. In particular, and according to possibilities:\n   - Connect these zones to the public transport network;\n   - Optimize space utilization, for example by increasing density or by providing multi-level constructions;\n   - Pay attention to their architectural and urban qualities, and"

    "### Objectifs 2035\n\nThe Vision represents a long-term objective (2060). It is necessary to set intermediate goals at closer intervals to be able to verify whether the measures taken are sufficient.\n\nThese goals are in line with energy and climate policies.\n\nThey take into account indigenous and renewable resources as well as heat emissions available within the cantonal territory. They integrate knowledge derived from the analysis of action domains.\n\n#### Consommation d'énergie\n\nThe 2035 consumption targets align with those in the federal energy law.\n\nThe final energy consumption per inhabitant must thus decrease by 43% compared to 2000 by 2035. A sub-objective is fixed for per capita electricity consumption. It must decrease by 13% between 2000 and 2035.\n\nFigure 2: Final energy consumption and per capita electricity consumption (excluding large industrial sites) in kWh/a, Valais Canton, 1990–2035\n\nSource: SEFH\n\nThese consumption targets are multiplied by the number of inhabitants to obtain the total consumption for the canton without the needs of large industrial sites.\n\nFinal energy consumption could remain stable until 2020 (7'960 GWh/a), then decrease by 23% until 2035 to reach 6'095 GWh/a.

    "### 1 Introduction\n\nAfter the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, the Federal Council and Parliament decided on the **progressive exit of Switzerland from nuclear energy**. Like other fundamental changes in the international energy context, this decision necessitates a transformation of the Swiss energy system. This is why the Federal Council elaborated the Energy Strategy 2050, which pursues the priorities set in the Energy Strategy 2007 while reinforcing them with new objectives.²\n\nThe Energy Strategy 2050 aims to:\n- Gradually phase out nuclear energy;\n- Increase energy efficiency and reduce final electricity and energy consumption;\n- Develop renewable energies and reduce CO₂ emissions.\n\n\"(The Energy Strategy 2050) must allow the country to take advantage of the new situation and maintain its high level of energy supply. At the same time, the strategy contributes to reducing environmental pollution linked to energy consumption in Switzerland.\"³\n\nThe entry into force of the total revision of the Energy Law and several ordinances in January 2018 was part of the first step of the Energy Strategy 2050.\n\nAfter being rejected by the National Council, then by the Council of States in June 2017, the introduction of an ecological fiscal reform,⁴ the second stage of the Energy Strategy 2050 consists of revising the CO₂ law and the electricity supply law, as well as the Electric Networks Strategy adopted by Parliament on December 15, 2017.\n\nValais, a land of energy, wants to continue working towards this energy transition. Thus, on April 17, 2019, the State Council approved the vision of Valais moving towards a 100% renewable and indigenous energy supply (by 2060) and intermediate goals up to 2035.\n\nThis vision responds to the government program of December 2017, which foresees the opportunity analysis of cantonal energy autonomy, as well as the State Council's strategy in sustainable development (Agenda 2030), published in November 2018, which notably highlights energy efficiency.\n\nThe long-term vision and intermediate energy goals are also aligned with climate policy.\n\nWith the adoption of this vision and these objectives, Valais aligns itself with exemplary practices.\n\n---\n\n¹ Introduction\n\n² OFEN, « Qu'est-ce que la Stratégie énergétique 2"

    "### 2 Context\n\n#### 2.1 International Context\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997 and entered into force in 2005, aimed for a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 8% for the European Union (EU) by 2012. The amendment effective in 2012 set a target of a 20% reduction by 2020.\n\nThe objectives for the period 2020-2050 are discussed during international conferences (e.g., COP21 in Paris in 2015, COP22 in Marrakech in 2016, etc.).\n\nEuropean law is not automatically adopted in Switzerland. However, it strongly influences the European industry. Given the geographical situation and the importance of trade exchanges, EU standards are rapidly reflected in Switzerland (e.g., lighting norms, appliance efficiency, motors, etc.).\n\n#### 2.2 National Context\n\nIn 2011, the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan shook public confidence in nuclear energy. In its 2050 energy strategy, the Federal Council decided to phase out nuclear energy over the medium term.\n\nThe 2050 energy strategy led to the revision of the law on energy approved by the people in May 2017. The entry into force of this new legislation in January 2018 marks the first step in the energy transition.\n\nThe total revision of the law on greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂ law) aligns with decisions made in Paris in 2015. These decisions will impact energy policy.\n\nSimilarly, the ongoing revision of the law on electricity supply will affect the development of renewable energies in Switzerland, winter dependency on electricity imports, and energy supply security."

    "### 3 Vision: «Valais, Terre d'énergies : ensemble vers un approvisionnement 100% renouvelable et indigène»\n\n#### Content:\n\nThe Valais region has abundant indigenous renewable energy resources (water, sun, wind, wood, etc.). Hydroelectric power alone can produce an average of 9,500 GWh/a. These resources will gradually return to local communities (communes for lateral rivers, canton for the Rhône) over the next three decades. Applying cantonal legislation to hydroelectric forces should progressively enable a hydroelectric production in Valais hands of around 5,700 GWh/a (60% of Valais production).\n\nThis peculiarity of Valais allows a long-term vision (2060) of a 100% renewable and indigenous energy supply.\n\nThis vision does not question the significant support of the Valais to Switzerland's electricity supply. Indeed, the Valais could, in the long term, meet its entire energy needs through its indigenous energy resources and contribute actively to Switzerland's and Europe's renewable electricity supply.\n\nThis auto-provisioning must be understood based on a monthly balance, with cross-border energy exchanges remaining essential for optimizing global electricity supply. It can be measured by the share of renewable and indigenous energy in Valais hands covering the provision. In 2015, self-provisioning was at 24%. By 2035, it should reach 59%, then 100% in 2060.\n\nThis vision requires a rapid reduction in energy demand and a strong increase in indigenous energy production.\n\nIn this perspective, the canton must set medium-term objectives aligned with those of the Confederation and compatible with federal legislation. Federal energy legislation, effective January 1, 2018, and legislation on CO₂ emissions reductions currently form the main safeguards.\n\nThe upcoming revision of the law on electricity supply will potentially have a strong influence on production and distribution, with the introduction of a new market model.\n\n#### Figure 9:\n\nThe figure shows projected energy demand (including industrial sites' consumption) and cumulative renewable energy production in Valais in GWh/a, projections 2015–2060."

    "### 3.3 Role and Evolution of Energy Agents\n\nIt is about ensuring that indigenous natural resources are utilized to meet the canton's energy needs on a monthly basis, but not immediately.\n\nThis means gradually replacing diesel and natural gas for heat production. Of course, wood, biomass, thermal solar, geothermal, and heat waste will play a role. However, the majority will involve installing heat pumps that will require electricity.\n\nStarting in 2035, the production of electricity in Valais (3980 GWh/a) should allow for covering the Valaisan electricity consumption every month.\n\nBy 2060, the electricity production in Valais should reach 7'170 GWh/a. It would then be 30% higher than the projected electricity consumption for 2060 (5'040 GWh/a). The valorization of this electricity will be a major issue for Valaisan communities.\n\n### 3.4 Intermediate Objectives\n\nVision 2060 represents a long-term objective. It is necessary to set intermediate objectives closer in time to verify if the measures taken are sufficient.\n\nThese objectives concern:\n\n- Energy consumption,\n- Renewable and indigenous energy production and the valorization of heat waste, as well as\n- The belonging of activities in the energy value chain.\n\nValais, Land of Energies: Together towards a 100% renewable and indigenous supply.

In 2015, valorized waste heat represented 40 GWh/a.\n- By 2035, 130 GWh/a of waste heat should be valorized. These should primarily come from UIOM (from SATOM in Monthey to UTO in Sion) and also from the industrial site at Sierre.\n- Waste heat valorization should contribute up to 12% to the cantonal heating production objective.\n- Valorization will mainly occur through distant heat networks. Investments needed for densification and construction of such networks are estimated at CHF 1 million per GWh. Connection investments are estimated at CHF 350,000 per GWh.\n\n### Section 4.2.2.4: Biomasse (Biomass)\n\n- In 2015, biomass valorization for heat production was 30 GWh/a.\n- By 2035, the objective is to produce 110 GWh/a essentially thanks to the renewable share of waste in the SATOM (extension) and UTO (under construction) thermal networks.

    "### 4.3 Energy Value Chain\n\nThe vision of a 100% renewable and indigenous energy supply implies that not only must sufficient energy be produced within the canton, but also that a majority of the energy value chain activities are in the hands of Valais. Thus, the objective of mastering activities in the energy value chain as outlined in the Energy Efficiency and Supply Strategy and the Hydropower Strategy remains relevant.\n\nPublic authorities and other Valais actors must therefore aim, at every opportunity, to master the activities in the energy value chain, from production to distribution, passing through commercialization.\n\nOptimizing the valorization of Valais' energy resources may require a restructuring of the cantonal energy economy. In the interest of the entire Valais community, it will be necessary to study optimal structures in the domains of electricity distribution and commercialization.\n\n#### 4.3.1 Electricity Production\n\nNew installations, particularly hydroelectric facilities, wind farms, and photovoltaic installations, should primarily be in the hands of Valais. This is generally the case.\n\nAfter the return of hydraulic concessions, Valais authorities should have 60% of the hydroelectric energy. Municipalities must prepare to exercise their right of return on hydroelectric installations in collaboration with the canton, which has a 30% participation right in these installations. This preparation encompasses political, strategic, legal, technical, economic, and financial aspects."
  ],
  "page_0099": [
    "### 4.3.2 Commercialisation de l'électricité\n\nWith the progressive return of hydraulic concessions and the growth of photovoltaic production, local productions will become more significant than consumption. Consequently, more and more municipalities will have to commercialize their production outside the local network manager's network.\n\nOn the other hand, the seasonal hydroelectric production will increasingly face competition from European and Swiss photovoltaic production.\n\nMoreover, the evolution of legislation tends to facilitate the commercialization of production by a larger number of clients, either through the creation of self-consumption communities or by opening up the electricity market entirely. Digitalization allows small producers and final consumers to be connected via a digital platform.\n\n### 4.3.3 Transport et distribution d'électricité\n\nElectricity transport and distribution are carried out by the electrical grid, which is in a monopoly situation. The remuneration for using the network is regulated by federal legislation on electricity supply. At this point, activities related to electricity transport and distribution are not subject to significant economic risks.\n\nDecentralizing electricity production requires adapting distribution networks and increasing energy flux monitoring.\n\nRegarding the interregional distribution of electricity at the cantonal level (125 kV and 65 kV), for the security of the canton's electricity supply, it becomes crucial that a single entity has a complete view of the network and manages it. The Government intends here to promote the concretization of the Grand Conseil's will.\n\nThus, in order to fully exploit the economic potential of cantonal energy resources, it seems prudent that Valais actors regroup around a common platform. Its mission would be to optimize the cantonal supply (self-consumption, demand management, optimization of hydro-electric production, storage) and to valorize growing surpluses as concessions return. This Valais platform could also contribute to securing Switzerland's electricity supply by playing a decisive role in regulating the national high-voltage transmission network.\n\nIn this context, the competencies and infrastructures, particularly those of FMV, will be precious.\n\nThe offer of new services, as well as the complexity of the electricity system, should encourage distribution network operators (GRD) to analyze closer approaches or more intensive collaborations, as some of these already exist among themselves. This should allow Valais actors to keep the added value in their hands."

With flexible storage capabilities provided by hydroelectric dams, Valais is well-positioned. The return of concessions for these facilities is of great interest.\n  - The anticipated strong reduction in the price of electric batteries could encourage all photovoltaic installation owners to increase their self-consumption rates. GRDs (Regional Energy Companies) and the shareholders of hydro-electric accumulation installations play a role in proposing services that capitalize on the storage capacity of these installations.\n  - For a GRD, battery storage at the scale of a quarter or a larger territory could represent an interest in addition to managing flexibility.\n\n### Section 4.3.5 Distribution de chaleur (Heat Distribution)\n\n- **Text Content:**\n  - Long-distance heat distribution through communal infrastructure is called for. This offers a rational alternative to building owners in densely built-up areas.\n  - It is important that these heat distribution infrastructures belong as much as possible to public collectives, directly or indirectly. This allows for the preservation of added value while protecting consumer interests.\n\n### Visual Elements:\n- **Top Image:** A photograph of a hydroelectric dam with tunnels and machinery visible, indicating the importance of hydroelectric storage in Valais.\n- **Bottom Image:** An aerial nighttime view of a city, likely representing urban areas where heat distribution infrastructure would be relevant.\n\nThe overall context suggests a focus on sustainable energy solutions, particularly in the context of renewable energy integration and local energy management in Valais."

    "### E.1 Water Management\n\nThe Federal Constitution obliges the Confederation to promote rational water use and to work towards establishing a sustainable balance between nature and human use of water. Various legal provisions and federal recommendations aim for integrated water management in Switzerland. They require coordination of water management activities and collaboration among different authorities, especially in light of anticipated climate change trends. Water management encompasses all human activities aimed at using water, protecting against their harmful effects, and safeguarding against excessive impacts on their quality (physical, chemical, and biological) and functions (nutritional, ecological, and landscape).\n\nThe canton of Valais has considerable water resources. Besides drinking water supply (mainly from springs and groundwater), water valorization primarily occurs in the domains of hydroelectric power (whose potential, already largely exploited, could still be optimized and developed), tourism and leisure, agriculture, or industry. In view of these multiple uses, effective water management is necessary to address problems and conflicts, notably:\n- **Water waste**: Losses in pipeline networks and unnecessary consumption are too high due to insufficient maintenance.\n- **Inadequate protection of water intakes**: It is often neglected by owners, particularly due to lack of information and awareness.\n- **Insufficient residual flows**: Hydroelectric developments have caused a significant reduction in alluvial dynamics on Rhône tributaries. The natural and landscape value of rivers and their tourist appeal are diminished. The dilution capacity of treated wastewater discharges is considerably reduced. The carrying and regeneration capacities of aquatic environments are affected. The existence of old water rights contributes equally to the insufficiency of residual flows.\n- **Impacts on nature and landscapes**: Construction of canals, riverbed modifications, and drastic maintenance of ancient river courses have led to the drying up of wetland riverine areas and the depletion of concerned natural habitats. Agricultural land degradation has significantly exacerbated the loss of wetlands.\n- **Reduction in the efficiency of sewage treatment plants (STEP)**: Most of the used water in the canton is connected to a sewage treatment plant. Hydraulic overloading of canals and STEP by rainwater and parasitic clear waters reduces their performance. Moreover, surface water quality objectives downstream of STEP discharges cannot be met due to the insufficiency of residual flows, inappropriate management of certain wastewater treatment installations, and the presence of difficult-to-degrade pollutants.\n- **Water pollution**: Certain agricultural practices related to the use of fertilizers and phytosanitary products"

These interventions have allowed significant development of agriculture, urbanization, and infrastructures throughout the plain. They have also led to a degradation of the natural habitats linked to the river and a loss of landscape diversity.\n\nRecent floods in 1987 and 1993 have shown that the previous corrections no longer guarantee sufficient security due to the limited capacity of the river and the deficient state of the dikes, leading to a risk of rupture even though the maximum capacity has not been reached. The October 2000 flood confirmed the need for the third Rhône correction. Today, there are more than 11,000 hectares, including 3,300 hectares in the building zone, which could be flooded in the Rhône plain. Potential damages within this perimeter are estimated at over 10 billion francs.\n\nThese findings and studies conducted during the 1990s led the Grand Council, in September 2000, to express its desire to improve the security of the plain by approving the general objectives and principles of the third Rh"

    "This document is part of a cantonal planning framework in Switzerland, specifically addressing the third correction of the Rhône River. It outlines the various stages of project development at both cantonal and regional levels, involving the Conseil de pilotage (COPIL) and COREPIL commissions. These commissions were tasked with developing a common vision for the regional plain's development, identifying synergies, potential conflicts, and integrating the third Rhône correction project within the territory.\n\nThe third correction of the Rhône presents a genuine opportunity for future development of the plain, as highlighted by the Swiss Territorial Project and the Cantonal Development Concept (CCDT). The document references territorial studies conducted in collaboration with municipalities, similar to agglomeration projects or the \"Sion-sur-Rhône\" approach. Opportunities for valorizing the territories traversed will continue through joint studies within the framework of the participation structures planned to accompany the project at each segment scale.\n\nThe realization of the project is divided into three phases, as per the Grand Conseil decision in September 2000 and the cantonal law on river management (LcACE). The first phase involved drafting the sectoral plan for the third Rhône correction (PS-R3), adopted by the State Council in June 2006, subject to danger zone delimitation. PS-R3 aimed to facilitate spatial coordination by defining flood zones according to the indicative danger map, indicating necessary widths for waterway functions and the third Rhône correction project (Rhône space, including future project footprint and reserve width), and clarifying rules applicable in these two types of space.\n\nThe second phase was the elaboration of the third Rhône correction development plan (PA-R3). Developed at a 1:10,000 scale, it presented the technical solution retained by Gletsch au Léman, coordinated with Vaud Canton for the Chablais region. It included information on the necessity of projected measures, justification of the chosen variant, presumed project footprint, land use consequences, and priorities and conditions for execution project preparation. This phase was completed with public consultation in 2011 regarding the Rhône flood zone project and related prescriptions, in accordance with LcACE. Approval is still ongoing.\n\nThe third phase involves a report on environmental impact (RIE) for the first stage. PA-R3 proposes a solution combining widening, bed lowering, and embankment"

    "### A.12 Third Correction of the Rhône\n\nThe PA-R3 updated (PA-R3 2012), its scope, and the deadlines for implementation were validated by the Council of State on November 21, 2012. The Canton of Vaud also validated the Chablaisian part on November 14, 2012.\n\nFollowing the positive vote of the Valaisan people on June 14, 2015, regarding the decree creating a fund for financing the project of the third correction of the Rhône, the Council of State formally adopted, on March 2, 2016, the Rhône management plan with the RIE 1st phase. During the same session, it also defined an agricultural strategy accompanying the third correction of the Rhône and adopted the current coordination sheet fixing the principles of insertion of the project in the plain.\n\nFinally, the third step involves the elaboration and realization of the execution projects by segment, according to the priorities defined in the PA-R3, which is the subject of a public inquiry. The execution projects refine the options defined in the PA-R3 and establish definitive construction provisions.\n\nThe works related to the priority measure of Viège began in 2009, and several measures anticipated for reinforcing the embankments located near built-up zones have been realized or are under implementation.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n\n1. Ensure sustainable protection of the entire plain against the dangers of Rhône flooding:\n   - By defining and applying land development prevention measures (flood zone plans and related prescriptions),\n   - By reserving space necessary for the Rhône,\n   - By implementing the global solution retained in the Rhône management plan according to the defined priorities.\n\n2. Coordinate the third Rhône correction project with:\n   - Sectoral plans of the Confederation and federal inventories according to Art. 5 LPN,\n   - Cantonal planning guidelines (Cantonal Development Concept and Cantonal Director Plan),\n   - Existing infrastructure and major public or private infrastructure projects,\n   - Other territorial development plans (e.g., communal or intercommunal director plans, agglomeration projects), in collaboration with municipalities and relevant partners.\n\n3.

Control the impact of the project on groundwater and avoid as much as possible the perimeters and zones S1 and S2 of groundwater protection and examine the consequences for agriculture (irrigation) and nature (wetlands) in the rest of the plain. Research, where necessary, adequate replacement solutions.\n8. Ensure integrated management of proper excess materials while respecting the following priorities: reuse within the framework of the project, reuse within the framework of public interest projects (e.g., under certain conditions, comprehensive land improvements, gravel lake embankments), reintroduction into the market, disposal in accordance with the cantonal waste management plan.\n9. Promote the remediation of polluted sites directly affected by the project, subject to cost proportionality.\n10. Take into account existing hydroelectric installations, explore synergies with new hydroelectric projects, notably at Massongex (project MBR), Lavey (project Lavey+), Vernayaz (project Nant de Drance), and Riddes (project Rhodix), and regulate the distribution of tasks and costs on the concerned segments.\n11.

These processes are continuously at work, inducing a landscape in constant evolution.\n\nThe processes shaping the landscape operate on very different temporal scales. Geological and geomorphological processes have little influence on the landscape at a human time scale. Climatic (climate evolution) and biological (vegetation, fauna) processes, however, can induce visible modifications in the landscape over several generations. Anthropogenic actions, particularly urbanization and transport, agriculture and forestry, water management, material extraction, energy production and transportation, as well as tourism and leisure, have immediate effects on the landscape.\n\nThe Federal Law on Nature and Landscape Protection (LPN) confers upon the Federal Council the task of drawing up national inventories.

    "### A.8 Landscape Protection, Management, and Valorization\n\nThe \"Paysage suisse\" (PS) concept, adopted by the Federal Council in 1997, sets out the objectives and binding measures for federal services responsible for landscape protection. To facilitate the implementation of the PS measures, the Office for the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (OFEV) defined the principles of the landscape protection strategy in \"Paysage 2020.\" This strategy outlines eight action fields for which a global policy must be established: land use and soil management, landscape and territorial policy, landscape and water courses, species and natural habitats, human presence in the landscape, participation, economic instruments, and resource use, research, and prospecting.\n\nQuality of the landscape projects (PQP), according to agricultural legislation, are developed at the regional level to preserve and develop attractive cultivated landscapes. Based on existing foundations and participatory processes involving the population and agriculture, these projects define regional objectives in terms of landscape and measures that allow farmers to benefit, within the framework of direct payments and contributions to the quality of the landscape (CQP).\n\nThe particularity of Valais lies in offering, on a restricted territory, representative landscapes of most of Europe's biogeographic regions. This peculiarity makes Valais a priority canton in landscape preservation. An inventory of cantonal importance landscapes is under development. The characteristic and identity landscapes of Valais are as follows:\n\n- **Plain landscape**: The original landscape of the Rhône plain was shaped by glaciers, followed by the Rhône river regime. This landscape is today strongly marked and remodeled by human activities. The Rhône plays the role of a backbone around which the main elements of the landscape are structured: agglomerations, residential zones, industrial zones, transport and energy infrastructures, separated by agricultural territories. This multifunctional landscape is the most evolved in the canton and certainly the most threatened, but also presents the greatest potential for improvement, notably thanks to the project \"Third Rhône Correction.\" Various other urban, agricultural, forestry, or nature and landscape projects tend to develop to counteract the threats to the Rhône plain landscape.\n\n- **Traditional agricultural landscape**: Framework of human activities on the slopes and in lateral valleys, identification pole for its inhabitants, habitat space hosting rare species due to agricultural exploitation, the traditional agricultural landscape is typical, multifunctional, and identity. This landscape was once"

This axis aims to systematically integrate landscape reflection and management measures in all activities affecting the territory, ensuring qualitative evolution of the landscape.\n\n#### Landscape Valorization:\n- **Landscape Valorization**: This axis focuses on valuing the landscape as a key element in environmental domains (biodiversity reservoirs and renewable resources), economic domains (e.g., tourism raw material, residential attractiveness), social and cultural domains (e.g., quality of life, relaxation, cultural identity). It seeks to promote awareness of the value of the landscape and its judicious use.\n\nThe tasks of territorial development are to coordinate, particularly with encouragement measures related to exploitation and maintenance, as stipulated by agricultural legislation and landscape protection laws. It is opportune to distinguish, in zone allocation plans (PAZ), the landscape objects to protect and the following zones:\n- **Landscape Protection Zone (art. 17 al. 1 of the Federal Law on Territorial Development (LAT), art. 23 of the Canton Law on Application of the Federal Territorial Development Law (LcAT))**: This serves to maintain landscapes of particular beauty and great value in their spatial relationship, diversity, and particularity. High demands are imposed during the analysis of needs, justification of localization, and integration into the landscape for new constructions or installations.\n- **Protected Agricultural Zone (art. 16 and 17 al. 2 LAT, art. 32 LcAT)**: This includes agricultural surfaces whose quality or particular charm warrants protection. The primary purpose remains agricultural use. No construction can be erected except for indispensable agricultural exploitation equipment and respecting the protection objective.\n\nThe landscape is a notion that encompasses the entire canton's territory. It is the habitat of residents, a tourism raw material, a natural resource and biodiversity reservoir, fulfilling essential functions to our civilization. It is constantly evolving, shaped by numerous human activities becoming more numerous, rapid, and complex. To preserve the ecological, economic, and socio-cultural potential of the landscape, the canton defines a strategy and coordinates the realization at all territorial scales, through protection, management, and valorization measures.\n\n### Coordination\n\n"

Au 31 décembre 2016, le canton possède environ 3'029 ha de zones à bâtir dévolues à l'habitat non construites. Cette réserve dépasse les besoins pour les 15 prochaines années, d'autant qu'il existe également un potentiel de développement à l'intérieur des zones considérées comme construites (voir annexe).\n\nDe manière plus précise, la croissance démographique est significative dans le Bas-Valais et, dans une moindre mesure, dans le Valais central, alors que le Haut-Valais voit globalement sa population rester stable, même si la population de plus de la moitié des communes augmente.\n\nDurant les dernières années, le développement démographique et économique s'est concentré dans la vallée du Rhône avec, dans le Valais romand, une croissance plus forte dans les communes périurbaines que dans les centres des agglomérations. Une croissance forte de la population a également été observée dans les centres touristiques, tandis que les communes de l'espace des coteaux et vallées latérales présentent globalement une évolution économique et démographique plus faible, parfois négative.\n\nEn revanche, les réserves de zones à bâtir dévolues à l'habitat se situent plutôt dans les communes rurales de montagne, alors qu'elles sont réduites dans les centres urbains de la plaine du Rhône.\n\nDans les communes pourvues de grandes réserves, on peut distinguer les situations suivantes :\n- les terrains ne sont"

Le « Complément au guide de la planification directrice » précise cet article et parle de « territoire d'urbanisation ». Celui-ci représente l'évolution attendue de l'urbanisation pour les 25 à 30 prochaines années et peut dès lors, en plus des zones à bâtir existantes, comprendre les extensions prévues pour le futur développement de l'urbanisation. Dans le cas du canton du Valais, qui dispose de réserves de zones à bâtir dévolues à l'habitat dépassant ses besoins pour les 25 prochaines années, ce territoire d'urbanisation est toutefois plus petit que les zones à bâtir homologuées.\n\nPour le canton du Valais, le territoire d'urbanisation, dénommé « périmètre d'urbanisation » (PU), comprend les zones à bâtir existantes et reflète l'évolution souhaitée en fonction des besoins pour les 25 à 30 prochaines années, soit deux périodes de planification. Le PU englobe tous les types de zones à bâtir (affectations principales 11 à 19 selon le modèle de géodonnées minimal « Plans d'affectation » de l'ARE), car il a pour objectif de poser les limites de l'extension à long terme de l'urbanisation.

The surplus potential for expansion of the building zones is indicated by the hatched area.\n\n2. **Scenario 1.2**: ZAB₀ > ZAB₁₅ et ZAB₀ ≤ PU\n   - The building zones homologated (ZAB₀) are greater than the building zones planned for the next 15 years (ZAB₁₅), but they are still within the perimeter of urbanization (PU). The hatched area indicates the surplus potential for expansion of the building zones.\n\n3. **Scenario 1.3**: ZAB₀ > PU\n   - The building zones homologated (ZAB₀) exceed the perimeter of urbanization (PU). The hatched area indicates the surplus potential for expansion of the building zones beyond the urbanized area.\n\n#### Explanation of the Figure\n\nThe figure depicts the delineation of the urbanization perimeter. It highlights the existing building zones allocated to housing (ZAB₀) and the building zones planned for the next 15 years (ZAB₁₅). The perimeter of urbanization (PU) is also shown. The hatched areas represent the surplus potential for expanding the building zones.\n\n#### Textual Content\n\nThe text explains that given the size of the existing building zones allocated to housing and the population and employment needs in the canton's communes, the perimeter of urbanization (PU) is generally smaller than the building zones homologated for the next 15 years (figure 1.3: ZAB₀ > PU). Building zones allocated to housing outside the PU should be rezoned. For those exceeding the needs for the next 15 years but located within the PU, measures must be taken, such as placing them in reserved zones or deferring allocation zones, to make them temporarily non-constructible.\n\nFor declining demographic communes, the development potential will be defined within the framework of the delineation of their urbanization"

The sectors dedicated to cross-country skiing requiring specific installations (e.g., technical snowmaking, lighting) are also considered as ski areas.\n\nSki areas, an important economic sector of our canton, are increasingly subject to competition and require adaptations. Moreover, winter tourism must organize itself around alpine tourist centers that are pointy, attractive, and competitive at the international level.\n\nSince the beginning of winter tourism in the 195"

    "### B.4 Skiable Areas\n\nThrough the Cantonal Concept of Territorial Development, the Canton of Valais expresses its desire to have six major alpine tourist centers (Aletsch, Zermatt, Saas-Fee, Crans-Montana-Aminona, the 4 Valleys, the Portes du Soleil) capable of offering large accommodation capacities and being competitive at the international level by strengthening their collaborations. Benefiting from their reach, several medium-sized centers (Belaup, Lauchernalp, Grächen, Leukerbad, Val d'Anniviers, Anzère, Ovronnaz) play an important role at the regional level. In addition to these winter tourism destinations, smaller ski areas exploit a local niche market. The search for solutions (complementarities, synergies with other destinations in the region) will allow their maintenance. Qualitative growth must take precedence over quantitative growth; the tourism industry should develop first through productivity improvement.\n\nThe evolution of customer needs and climate change push mechanical lift operators to develop their ski area towards higher altitudes or onto sectors ensuring better skiing conditions. The necessary adaptation of ski areas to meet demand involves improving existing areas qualitatively, and replacing or reinforcing existing installations with more modern, comfortable, and energy-efficient equipment to obtain better complementarity and ensure sufficient profitability. This optimization should also be considered within the framework of complementary installations across seasons (e.g., skiing in winter, VTT and hiking in summer), in an integrated tourism reflection, drawing on the local tourism policy guidelines set out in the Tourism Law (LTour). The creation of new ski areas is thus not envisaged in principle.\n\nIt is important, for attractiveness and competitiveness, to have efficient access points to ski areas. Moreover, encouraging partnerships between mechanical lift companies and nearby accommodation structures is encouraged. The possibilities of optimization through cooperation, mergers, extensions, and/or interconnections of certain ski areas that appear exploitable should be analyzed, both transfrontally.\n\nTechnical skiing represents an increasingly important competitive factor for most Valaisan ski areas. This skiing must be coordinated at the planning stage with a global evaluation of impacts on the environment, and not within the framework of the construction authorization procedure.\n\nAll these improvements are carried out in a perspective of sustainable tourism development. Beyond their economic importance, ski areas and their infrastructures (e.g., mechanical lifts, pistes, technical skiing installations) have significant consequences on nature, landscape,"

    "### C.7 Installations générant un trafic important (IGT)\n\nThe IGT have a significant territorial impact and their installation requires coordination to avoid undesirable effects on the environment and mobility. In this context, it will be necessary to define a population basin relative to a critical size (population basin for the less regional), and to carry out intermunicipal planning. To avoid the uncontrolled development of new IGT in the periphery of urban centers, it will be advisable, for example, to locate them according to criteria of positive planning, and to analyze the relevance of favoring synergies between different IGT activities (shopping centers, sports installations, leisure facilities). It will also be necessary to promote measures of encouragement (e.g., increase in public transport offers), in order to avoid the overload of TIM related to IGT.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n\n1. Realize the IGT based on regional, or even cantonal, needs, and orient their installation so that they respect an equitable distribution within the canton and reinforce the attractiveness of urban centers.\n2. Favor, for the IGT and their infrastructures, constructive solutions that ensure measured land use by taking into account their multifunctional potentialities.\n3. Prioritize the installation of IGT near population basins and public transport hubs, in order to favor multimodal accessibility and limit the nuisances linked to TIM.\n4. Provide adequate management of access, circulation, and parking spaces, taking into account modal distribution in favor of public transport and road network capacity.\n5. Ensure an adequate connection to the road network in terms of capacity, fluidity, and security, as well as optimal accessibility to IGT by eco-friendly modes of transport (e.g., sustainable mobility).\n6. Define a minimum service level class C (norm VSS 640 281) for the IGT, and examine the possibility of providing shuttle services for punctual events.\n7. Integrate shopping centers offering daily consumption goods or non-intrusive ones in urban centers, inside residential zones, near public transport services or pedestrian routes.\n8. Justify, in periurban areas, shopping centers offering daily consumption goods based on their proximity vocation and efficient public transport links.\n9. Install shopping centers offering specific consumption goods near major traffic routes and primarily outside urban centers.\n10. Reduce the energy dependence of IGT (low energy needs, renewable energy sources, valorization of internal or external heat emissions).\n"

However, wind turbines can alter landscapes and potentially cause nuisances or conflicts of interest due to their use of natural resources rather than land.\n- **National Objectives**: In 2010, the Confederation aimed for national wind energy production of 600 GWh by 2030. Given the risk of electricity shortages due to rising final consumption, the inability to import electricity contracts with France, and the federal decision not to grant general authorization for nuclear power plant construction, these objectives were recently revised. The Federal Energy Strategy now aims for 660 GWh in 2020 and 1,460 GWh in 2030. This policy is also reflected in the Federal Wind Energy Concept.\n- **Valais Context**: Planning for wind projects is subject to major issues, including economic, environmental, and societal factors.

    "This image is a page from a strategic planning document related to wind energy installations in Switzerland. It includes a map of Switzerland with shaded areas indicating average wind speeds at 75 meters above ground level. The legend below the map specifies the wind speed ranges in meters per second (m/s) for different colors, ranging from light blue (less than 4 m/s) to dark red (greater than or equal to 8 m/s).\n\nThe text accompanying the map discusses ongoing projects for wind energy installations. It notes that while other projects are under study, the state council has not yet made a decision on the suitability of the proposed sites due to unresolved conflicts of interest or open questions. The Valais region, benefiting from favorable wind conditions in certain areas like the Rhône bend and cols, could become one of the main national players in wind energy production. The canton aims to produce over 200 GWh by 2020 through the operation of approximately 90 wind farms, each with an average power capacity of 2 MW, grouped into about ten wind farm parks.\n\nThe document also mentions that achieving this objective requires considering impacts on transport and distribution networks, storage possibilities, and local grid adaptation to absorb decentralized electricity production. Another goal is to maintain over 50% control of the wind energy value chain by public and private actors in the Valais, including energy distribution companies, pension funds, and local businesses. Rapid growth in wind energy, primarily in the hands of local collectivities and enterprises, would increase the share of locally produced electricity to meet cantonal needs before returning hydraulic concessions."

Respect, within the framework of wind farm planning, the interests of the population, agriculture, nature, landscapes, and fauna, and take into account built-up areas, interference risks, natural hazards, as well as constraints related to air navigation safety and military activities, based on an interest weighing.\n3. Respect the minimum distances for installation in building zones (i.e., comply with noise protection ordinance requirements (OPB)), rural residential sectors in hamlets, rural habitat maintenance zones, ISOS zones, protection zones, forests, Rhone, waterways, railway lines, and high-voltage lines mentioned in the cantonal concept.\n4. Require, for the implementation of a wind farm, the detailed development plan instrument (PAD), article 12 of the cantonal law on the application of federal territory development law (LoCAT), accompanied by an environmental impact study if the installed power exceeds 5 MW.\n5. Limit, outside building zones, small installations connectable to an existing network.\n6. Authorize, based on an interest weighing, small installations not connectable to the network only in difficult-to-access locations (e.g., alpine barn, mountain cabin) or on existing infrastructure for which the impossibility of installing photovoltaic installations has been demonstrated beforehand, or in cases where a photovoltaic installation alone cannot meet all needs.\n\n##### Actions to Follow\n\n**The canton:**\na) Updates, at the appropriate moment, the cantonal strategy and the cantonal concept for promoting wind energy, taking into account the evolution of knowledge and technology, and stating the objectives to achieve as well as the measures and resources to put in place to achieve them;\nb) Encourages municipalities to identify, on their territory, potentially interesting sites for developing wind farms;\nc) Designates suitable sites for wind farm development;\nd) Coordinates the planning of wind farms with neighboring cantons or countries if it is established or probable that the project impacts exceed the cantonal framework;\ne) Performs the tasks of planning, coordination, and legislative and technical assistance related to wind energy matters within its competence;\nf) Participates, in case of need, in campaigns and information sessions on wind energy organized by project initiators and municipalities.\n\n**The municipalities:**\na) Plans, on their territory,"

During the elaboration of the PAD, an examination of the relevant criteria must be conducted at this stage of the procedure; the Canton's Concept for Promoting Wind Energy must be reviewed. Projects having significant effects on territorial organization and the environment are classified in the \"coordinated planning\" category when it is proven, during coordination, that the project meets the following conditions:\n\nI. Local authorities of the site community support the project and coordinate with neighboring communes, concerned cantons, and bordering countries;\nII. Sufficient wind quality measures have been implemented over a period of at least 12 months, demonstrating that the site is favorable for accommodating a wind farm, indicating the possibility of annual production of the order of 10 GWh;\nIII. Grid connection appears feasible underground;\nIV. The wind farm avoids cantonal and communal protection zones (nature, landscape, open spaces, built-up areas, groundwater protection zones), regional and supraregional faunal corridors, sensitive areas for bats and national objects (e.g., IFP, ISOS, IVS, OROEM, biotopes);\nV. The wind farm can be envisaged on ridges as well as in regional nature reserves, biosphere reserves, and archaeological zones;\nVI. The possibility of transporting installations during the construction phase and access to these during the exploitation phase is demonstrated;\nVII. The wind farm, including installations exceeding a total height of 60 m in built-up areas and 25 m in other areas or occupying a determinant surface of the cadastral limit of obstacles, has been announced to the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (OFAC)"

    "### B.2 Tourism Accommodation\n\nIt is primarily the responsibility of the tourism sector and its enterprises to address the challenges ahead and define a corresponding strategy to continue the development of Valais tourism. The Canton of Valais intends to continue supporting the tourism sector proactively and aims to engage particularly in the following themes over the coming years: maintenance of winter sports, promotion of year-round occupation through the development of products/experiences for summer, regulation flexibility, sensitization of the population (especially youth) to the importance and tourism and mountain sports goals.\n\nThe Law of 20 March 2015, effective as of 1 January 2016, limits the realization of secondary residences to 20% of dwellings. However, it does not resolve the issue of \"cold beds,\" which represent nearly half of total tourist beds.\n\nCommunes that have not reached the threshold of 20% of secondary residences but are part of the influence area of a tourist center will also take measures to manage secondary residences and promote primary residences and organized accommodation.\n\nMaintaining the attractiveness of tourist communes as places of residence requires specific measures. Transforming primary residences into secondary residences, especially in village centers and well-served public transport areas, could prove problematic: a built-up village that is lively contributes significantly to the attractiveness of a site as a place of residence, especially during low season.\n\nMajor projects that have a significant impact on the territory and environment (art. 8 al. 2 LAT) must be coordinated at the cantonal level. The development of a vision and a common planning framework (at the destination scale) for these resort projects is a necessary basis to facilitate their realization. The elaboration of a development concept or intermunicipal plan at the destination scale is a good way to establish priorities, define the main projects, and plan adequate locations, exploiting possible synergies with the destination infrastructure (e.g., mechanical lifts, baths, golf courses). This pooling of resources also makes the destination offer more attractive.\n\n\\section*{Coordination}\n\n\\section*{Principles}\n1. Strengthen the competitiveness of destinations by prioritizing the construction and commercialization of beds with high occupancy rates.\n2. Develop organized accommodation projects (e.g., hotels, resorts) in synergy with existing tourism infrastructures in the destination (e.g., mechanical lifts, baths, golf courses).\n3. Promote innovative and alternative forms of accommodation that enhance the attractiveness of a region.\n"

    "### B.2 Tourist Accommodation\n\n#### Path to Follow\n\n**The Canton:**\na) Guides municipalities in the development of the \"local tourism policy guidelines\" and municipal development options;\nb) Evaluates, through justifying reports of zone allocation plans (PAZ) and intermunicipal development plans, the coherence of projects to be carried out with the proposed tourism development vision for the destination and the justification of the need;\nc) Allocates financial aids (e.g., investment credits, tourist subsidy attribution, NPR, interest-free loans) while taking into account the objectives defined by the municipality(s) in the communal (intermunicipal) planning.\n\n**The Municipalities:**\na) Defines the strategic sectors necessary for tourism development using the \"local tourism policy guidelines\" and their development options, and, if necessary, in an intermunicipal development plan;\nb) Delimits, for major tourist accommodation projects, the tourist activity zones within their PAZ according to Art. 15 LAT in the urban perimeter, ensuring their availability while preserving the strategic importance perimeters necessary for their development;\nc) Delimits, for innovative or alternative accommodation projects conforming to the legislation on secondary residences, tourist activity zones, according to Art. 18 LAT, while respecting the fundamental principle of separating constructible and non-constructible parts of the territory. These zones meet the following criteria:\n   - The project is generated by the site itself and/or allows for the rehabilitation or valorization of an existing structure, or results from a variant evaluation;\n   - The alternative offer fits within the niche market and contributes to the region's attractiveness;\n   - Potential conflicts with land use, agriculture, forestry, the environment (e.g., major risks, noise, water), nature protection, and landscape (e.g., IFP, IVS, ISO5, biotopes), reserved water spaces, tertiary installations, and natural dangers have been evaluated through an impact notice. The integration of the project into the natural landscape and built environment can be assured;\n   - Zone placement is conditioned by a special planning process. In case of project non-realization within the fixed timeframe, the return of the concerned surface to its previous allocation is automatic;\n   - Competence for issuing authorizations in the tourist activity zone that do not fit within the existing building continuity (Art. 18 LAT) is delegated to the municipality by the canton (Commission cantonale des constructions);\n   - Complete"

    "### B.2 Tourism Accommodation\n\n#### f) Promote better use of secondary residences and encourage hotels and primary residences at an advantageous price by defining measures to achieve this (e.g., analyzing building reserves and adapting land development tools, creating reserved zones, defining a maximum share of secondary residences);\ng) Observe the evolution of tourism accommodation situations and conduct necessary censuses;\nh) Carry out the inventory of built heritage (according to art. 8 and ss. of the cantonal law on nature protection, landscape, and sites) indispensable for eventual identification of buildings worthy of being protected or characteristic of the site according to art. 9 al. 1 and 2 LRS.\n\n### Conditions to Respect for Coordinated Management (Large Projects, Resorts)\n\nLarge tourism accommodation projects, whose footprint exceeds 10,000 m² or require an impact report in the sense of the OEIE, have significant effects on territorial organization and the environment. They must be classified in the category « coordinated management » before subsequent procedures of allocation plans and construction authorization requests are initiated. Projects having significant effects on territorial organization and the environment are classified in the category « coordinated management » when it is proven, within the coordination framework, that the project meets the conditions and criteria of localization as follows:\n\nI. It is demonstrated that the project complies with the « local tourism policy guidelines » and the municipal development options, responds to a regional need, and, if it has a supramunicipal impact, figures in an intermunicipal plan;\nII. Synergies with existing tourist infrastructure in the destination and region are identified and valued, and the project is located near these;\nIII. Potential conflicts with territorial development, agriculture, forestry (protective or not), the environment (e.g., major risks, noise, water), nature and landscape protection (e.g., IFP, IVS, ISOS, biotopes), reserved water spaces, third-party installations, and natural dangers have been identified, and integration of the project into the natural landscape and construction can be ensured;\nIV. The project is located near the existing mobility network (private or public) and has sufficient access to absorb the expected traffic volume.\n\n### Documentation\n\nSBMA, Built Heritage - Guide for Municipalities – Inventory, Classification, Protection, 2017\nValais Canton, Canton of Valais Tourism Policy, 2016\nDEET, Development Strategy for Tourism Accommodation – Initial"

This landscape holds great value as cultural heritage and an identity element for the local population and constitutes, through its beauty, a real asset for tourism. \n\nThe rural landscape, composed of pastures, hay meadows, irrigation networks, paths, dry stone walls, agricultural constructions, and hamlets, is directly linked to traditional mountain agriculture. However, this has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of mechanization, leading to the loss of many small agricultural buildings (stables, barns, granaries) and their original functions. \n\nHowever, these agricultural buildings are important and characteristic elements of the traditional rural landscape. Their demolition and disappearance could affect the physiognomy of this landscape and devalue it. The challenge lies in preserving the characteristic buildings of the landscape worthy of protection through appropriate reassignments and transformations, as well as maintaining agricultural surfaces to safeguard and enhance these rural landscapes.\n\nExisting legislation addresses several times the old constructions outside the building zone, which no longer serve agricultural purposes. It authorizes the change of the allocation of existing constructions, particularly when they belong to precise zones defined in the cantonal development plan, namely:\n\na) Settlement zones and protected constructions as characteristic elements of the landscape (art. 32bis of the law concerning the application of the federal law on territorial planning (LcAT) and art. 39 al. 2 of the ordinance on territorial planning (OAT));  \nb) Hamlet zones and rural habitat maintenance zones outside"

    "### A.5 Rural Settlement Areas, Hamlets, and Maintenance of Rural Habitat\n\nThe application of this article does not require a base in the cantonal development plan.\n\nThe cases mentioned above concern constructions outside the building zone, for which construction project authorizations fall under the competence of the cantonal authority (art. 25 LAT). However, the management of constructions outside the building zone also has a direct link with the planning of the community's affected zones. Therefore, close collaboration between cantonal and communal authorities is essential.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n1. Preserve traditional rural landscapes, develop extensive tourism, and maintain resident population and agriculture in mountain regions.\n2. Through the rural settlement areas and protected landscape constructions, allow a reclassification adapted and respectful of the original aspect of existing buildings in order to preserve the traditional rural landscape (art. 39 al. 2 OAT).\n3. Protect existing small urban entities having cultural and historical value, where zoning in the building zone is not an appropriate solution, by creating hamlet zones and maintaining rural habitat (art. 33 OAT).\n4. Maintain permanent habitat in traditionally dispersed residential territories through the possibility of changing the designation of existing buildings (art. 39 al. 1 OAT).\n5. Allow the reclassification of unused rural buildings situated outside the building zone for residential purposes, based on corresponding federal legal grounds, respecting territorial development objectives and strategic principles. This solution complements existing possibilities provided by art. 39 al. 2 OAT and does not entail additional costs or public authorities' commitments.\n\n#### Steps to Follow\n\n**The canton:**\na) Examines, in collaboration with communes, and approves the delineation of rural settlement areas and protected construction zones as characteristic elements of the landscape, hamlet zones, and maintenance of rural habitat, thus defining traditionally dispersed residential territories, based on fixed criteria and conditions (see below);\nb) Issues corresponding construction authorizations in accordance with principles, conditions, and obligations fixed, while taking into account the provisions of the site subcommission and the commune;\nc) Monitors, in case of illegal modification, ensuring that a decision to restore the right state is taken and executed;\nd) Prepares and implements support for the execution related to the delineation of these zones and the appropriate implementation of changes in designation and existing building transformations.\n\n**Communes:**\na) Delineates in their zone allocation plan (PAZ), considering"

    "### A.5 Rural Settlement Areas, Hamlets, and Rural Habitat Maintenance Zones\n\n#### Key Points:\n- Most buildings in these areas are still occupied year-round or serve agricultural or local economic activities.\n- Architectural transformations authorized in this zone contribute to maintaining the resident population or local economic activities. Significant population growth, employment creation, or secondary residences are not anticipated unless planned.\n- Creating a hamlet and rural habitat maintenance zone incurs no additional collective equipment costs.\n\nFor delineating this zone within the PAZ (Plan d'Aménagement et de Zonage), the following conditions must be met:\n- The building group has cultural and historical value, documented through an identification card.\n- Hamlet and rural habitat maintenance zones are limited to the already constructed perimeter.\n\nThe RCCZ (Regulation Concerning Construction) specifies conditions for changing the use of existing constructions:\n- Proof of need is required for changes of use, renovations, partial transformations, reconstructions, and moderate extensions.\n- Transformations must preserve and enhance the characteristic structure of the building and the site's quality.\n- Changes of use for agricultural constructions do not require new constructions to maintain agricultural exploitation.\n- New constructions for non-agricultural purposes are prohibited unless they allow for maintaining or reinforcing an existing infrastructure supply.\n\n#### c) Dispersed Traditional Habitats (art. 39 al. 1 OAT)\n\nDesignation of these territories is based on the following criteria:\n- The territory is characterized by traditional dispersed permanent habitation (historical base).\n- Buildings are located at a certain distance from existing villages.\n- Permanent habitation corresponds to the commune’s development options.\n\nTerritories meeting these criteria must be designated on the cantonal directorial plan map.\n\nDispersed traditional habitats territories are more precisely delimited in the PAZ as perimeters.\n\nThe RCCZ specifies conditions for changing the use of existing constructions:\n- For changes of use to residential purposes unrelated to agriculture, existing buildings containing dwellings must be inhabited one year after transformation.\n- For changes of use of existing buildings or complexes containing dwellings to small artisanal or local commerce uses, the part reserved for artisanal or commercial purposes generally should not occupy more than half of the construction or complex.\n- The exterior appearance and basic architectural structure must remain essentially unchanged.\n- Changing the use does not imply a replacement construction that would impose any necessity.\n- The new use implies at most a slight extension of existing facilities, and all additional infrastructure costs incurred by authorized use are"

    "### C.9 Military Installations\n\nThe implementation of the new military parking concept will extend over several years, with approval by the Federal Council for the \"structures\" part planned for 2019, and the global DEVA project to be completed in 2021.\n\nMilitary law confers a particular legal status on military installations and does not grant limited competencies to cantons.\n\nAt the main site level, the 2016 concept provides for the maintenance of the Sierre military police post and the Sion arms square, the closure of the Brig barracks, as well as those of the St-Maurice-Lavey arms square and infrastructure and training centers. Some of these installations are subject to transfers. Additionally, the Valais Canton acts as a partner with the city of Sion for the management and financing of the Sion airport, the suppression, in the long term, of the Sion military airfield, and welcomes the fact that the civil airport could serve as a departure base according to the modalities negotiated with the Confederation.\n\nAt the secondary site level, the concept foresees the maintenance of 25 cantonments, 3 logistics centers (Simplon, Visp, Sion), 6 firing or exercise sites, and 3 border crossings (Dorénaz/Vernayaz, Collonges/Evionnaz, Aigle/Collombey-Muraz). It envisages the closure of 7 cantonments (Obergoms, Ulrichen, Reckingen, Raron, Sembrancher, Champex, Dorénaz), 3 logistics centers or engagement sites (Ulrichen, Brig, Evionnaz), as well as 12 firing or exercise sites. Some of these installations are also subject to transfers.\n\nThe Simplon, Brig, Niedergesteln, Sierre, Sion, and St-Maurice service sites will be maintained. Only the Reckingen-Gluringen service site will be closed. The Valaisian infrastructures listed in the PSM are annexed.\n\nValais is one of the Swiss cantons most affected by the military parking concept, particularly with the closure of the St-Maurice arms square and military infrastructure in the Conches Valley.

    "This image is a page from a strategic planning document titled \"D.8 Infrastructures aéronautiques\" (Aeronautical Infrastructure). It discusses the civil aviation domain and how these infrastructures align with sectoral objectives. The conditions for equipment and operation of different aeronautical installations are fixed within the PSIA (Plan Sectoriel d'Infrastructure Aéronautique). Coordination protocols facilitate the elaboration of installation-specific PSIA files and ensure coordination with the cantonal director's plan. The optimal use of existing installations prioritizes new equipment construction.\n\nAs a mountain canton, Valais needs airbases capable of performing rescue, refueling, or protection missions (e.g., avalanche prevention, construction of protective works). Adequate hangar, maintenance, and helicopter refueling bases are necessary. Synergies should also be sought between commercial activities and rescue operations to reduce costs, particularly those generated by training and terrain reconnaissance. Maintaining and consolidating an adequate spatial distribution of helicopter bases is essential to enhance the versatility of the concerned companies.\n\nTo maintain and promote the quality of the tourism offer, Valais must ensure global accessibility by air and provide added-value services to national and international clientele (transfers, panoramic flights, heliskiing landings).\n\nGiven the growth of handling activities, commercial aviation development (rapid access to tourist centers), and business aviation, Sion Airport is seen as a complementary solution to Cointrin. These markets generate highly qualified jobs and contribute to the airport's functioning (Study on the potential development of Sion Airport). The airport's impact on the territory is considered, especially in urban development in the city of Sion. Due to ongoing redeployment of air forces, the canton aims to maintain infrastructure capable of accommodating commercial and business aviation.\n\nThe map at the bottom illustrates the aeronautical infrastructure in Valais, including regional airports with line traffic, aviation fields, heliports, PAM (Parachute Assisted Module) landing sites, and heliskiing descents from Italy.

    "### E.2 Supply and Protection of Potable Water\n\nThe implementation of these measures requires particular importance if Switzerland wishes to conserve the privilege of a reliable, economic, and high-quality water supply while preparing for the changes that are coming.\n\nIn Valais, by the end of 2015, nearly three-quarters of municipalities had delineated the zones and perimeters of protection of underground waters according to legal requirements. This work should constitute a priority for municipalities in adapting their water resource allocation plans (PAZ). At the communal level, the analysis of the current situation demonstrates that water supply remains confronted with certain constraints, which can be listed as follows:\n\n- **Effective protection of potable water resources:** Certain mountain sources are fed by large catchment basins, often characterized by groundwater flows through complex and heterogeneous geological environments. The real risks represented by activities on the territory can be negatively influenced and distorted.\n- **Resource sharing:** Municipalities required to share potable water resources may encounter obstacles related to property rights definitions, as well as water regime management, especially when the size of the source feeding basins exceeds the communal territory dimensions.\n- **Unequal geographical distribution of water:** Some municipalities are exempt from water supply problems, while others periodically face the problem of water shortage due to a too diverse source feeding, the risk of dry season drawdown, or pollution risks linked to non-compliant activities in the source feeding basin.\n- **Demand fluctuations:** Population evolution (particularly seasonal fluctuations related to winter tourism), consumption habits, and activity evolution directly influence potable water demand. The repercussions of demand variations on water resources are difficult to evaluate objectively due to numerous factors to consider.\n- **Emergency water supply:** The situation of municipalities and their ability to rely on functional feeding in case of failure, critical dry season, or crisis period are insufficiently recorded at the cantonal level. According to cantonal law, each municipality is responsible for ensuring sufficient quantity and quality of water supply to its citizens.\n- **Quantification of losses:** Distribution networks in poor condition or poorly maintained can induce losses that may reach more than half of the total available volume.\n- **Complexity of detecting pollution and treating underground waters:** Diffuse pollution sources (e.g., discharges, agricultural operations, road surfaces, industrial activities) make the impact of pollution on underground water resources and the measures to be taken to treat them complex. Moreover, the respect of legal requirements within the zones and perimeters of underground water protection is not always assured"

    "### E.2 Supply and Protection of Potable Water\n\nThe main measures of the Valais Canton's water strategy, applicable in the short or medium term and of high priority, are as follows:\n- Creation of a systematic overview of potable water supply in Valais communes;\n- Optimization of potable water intake protection;\n- Assurance of sufficient maintenance of water intakes, reservoirs, and potable water distribution networks;\n- Improvement of supply security through intermunicipal cooperation.\n\nThus, the cantonal strategy aims to strengthen efforts to sensitize different actors to optimal management of potable water and to determine their responsibilities. To anticipate potential conflicts between \"potable water supply\" and \"soil and groundwater use,\" territorial coordination taking into account all interests present must be ensured, and the principles of integrated management are to be defined.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n1. Ensure, for the needs of the population and economy, a long-term potable water supply, as a public good, of optimal quality and sufficient quantity.\n2. Improve potable water supply security by identifying high-quality water resources with potential for exploitation, promoting network interconnection, modernizing transport and storage facilities, developing synergies with major projects (e.g., third Rhône correction) and strengthening intermunicipal cooperation, particularly within the framework of emergency water reserves.\n3. Regularly maintain potable water supply infrastructure to minimize network losses and the risk of contamination during transportation from intakes to consumers.\n4. Use potable water economically, notably by limiting its use for irrigation, technical snowmaking, and industrial activities, and improving and maintaining distribution networks adequately.\n5. Optimize the protection of intakes, springs, and phreatic aquifers for potable water supply, notably by defining and approving protection zones and perimeters for underground waters across the entire canton territory.\n6. Define technical prescriptions detailing protection measures and restrictions on the use of underground water assets within protection zones and perimeters, and ensuring their application.\n7. Avoid any project that could endanger potable water supply and underground water protection, particularly in the domains of industry, construction, and agriculture.\n8. Ensure the population and municipalities' information and advice regarding potable water supply and underground water protection."

Statistics show that the number of golfers per 1,000 inhabitants in Switzerland more than doubled between 2000 and 2010. The development of new golf courses has sought to meet this growing demand and reinforce the summer tourism offer. The Valais, with its offer tailored to the needs of the market, has developed a golf course with 18 holes requiring approximately 40 to 50 hectares, while an average of 20 to 30 hectares is needed for a 9-hole course. Golf courses thus have significant impacts on the territory and environment, and can conflict with other land uses, particularly agriculture, forests, and nature conservation.\n\nThe Confederation, through the Federal Law on Sports Promotion, supports all activities aimed at increasing physical fitness, promoting health, encouraging individual development, and strengthening social cohesion. Moreover, the economic and tourist importance of sports in general and sporting events, such as the European Masters of Crans-Montana, cannot be overstated.\n\nA sustainable territorial development must, however, take into account the Federal Law on Territorial Planning (LAT), which sets out, in Article 3, the principles governing territorial development. For golf courses, the principles consist in reserving sufficient arable land for agriculture and conserving natural sites and territories subject to abandonment. These principles must be taken into consideration.\n\nThe bases defined above encourage the development of infrastructure and sports activities, starting from the principle that not everything can be realized everywhere. This last principle is also a central aspect of the cantonal strategy"

It seems unlikely that many new projects will materialize in the coming years.\n\nTherefore, it is now necessary to examine to what extent new projects are compatible with the goals and principles of territorial development oriented towards measured land use. Moreover, a location and spatial impact assessment of potential new golf courses must be ensured, respecting the principles of sustainable development. It is also essential to consider possible returns to agriculture or nature of golf courses.\n\n\\section*{Coordination}\n\n\\subsection*{Principles}\n\n1. Ensure that a golf course meets regional needs and guarantee an equitable distribution of these courses within the canton.\n2. Create an adequate zone in the zoning plan (PAZ) according to Art. 18 LAT and Art. 25 of the Canton Law on Territorial Development (LcAT) and require a detailed development plan (PAD, Art. 12 LcAT), accompanied by an environmental impact report, for every golf course of 9 holes or more.\n3. Ensure that only constructions and installations directly related to the golf course, such as restaurants, changing rooms, or technical facilities, can be built in such a zone. Winter tourism installations can also be installed with winter sports facilities.\n4. Limit necessary development works to the minimum and design golf courses so that they respect natural topography and integrate well into the landscape, and they can be reallocated to agricultural zones in case of non-realization, cessation of activity, major needs for agriculture, or crisis.\n5. Use existing parking spaces rationally and, in the context of creating new parking spaces, limit their size to need and design them to minimize their footprint on the ground and landscape.\n\n\\subsection*{Steps to Follow}\n\nThe canton:\na) ensures a balanced geographical distribution of 9-hole and 18-hole golf courses within the canton;\nb"

Historically, flood protection measures often prioritized agricultural or urban land gains, leading to the construction of embankments and other structures. Today, watercourse management takes into account additional functions beyond flood control, including ecological maintenance and human activities like tourism and recreation. The document emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to water management, considering both ecological and socio-economic aspects.\n\n### Diagram\nA diagram illustrates the interaction between different thematic areas related to water management:\n- **Espace réservé aux cours d'eau (and étendues d'eau)**:"

    "### A.13 River Management, Renaturation, and Maintenance\n\nThe federal and cantonal legislation is based on a comprehensive vision that integrates all functions of rivers. Its aim is to restore the natural functions of waters while reconciling flood protection objectives, nature and landscape protection, and agricultural and energy policies.\n\nIntegrated water management must consider contradictory objectives. Thus, flood control often involves creating sediment retention basins, whereas river revitalization requires channel restoration. Bed stabilization aims to reduce erosion problems (seals) but interrupts longitudinal continuity and disrupts fish migration. Bank management (embankments, walls) cuts off transverse exchanges (water/riverine/millieu terrestre). Bed impermeabilization prevents contact between the river course and the aquifer. The current approach developed within the framework of cantonal plans requested by the Confederation aims to define a global strategy taking into account all imperatives, in order to determine coordinated measures.\n\nThe Confederation's strategy aims to restore the natural functions of heavily modified rivers over the long term. First, it defines the ERE, which must allow their flow in a sufficient space to meet identified needs (guaranteeing natural functions, flood protection, and water use). In this space, the objective is to restore a state close to nature, with a proper dynamic (morphology, flow regimes, and channel), colonized by typical natural biocenoses forming characteristic elements of the landscape. To achieve this, cantons establish a river revitalization planning that must be taken into account in intercommunal director plans and zone allocation plans (PAZ), with a schedule of measures. The cantonal planning of revitalizations must cover the entire cantonal territory, at the scale of hydrological basins, and designate priority river courses and sections where maximum efficiency would be achieved in restoring natural functions with minimal costs. Renaturations focus on restoring an ecologically balanced state, a channel regime close to a natural state, and free fish migration, thus limiting serious impacts due to existing dams (related to hydroelectric power). A minimum flow must be guaranteed in parallel by improving water intakes.\n\nThe canton commits to respecting the strategy and federal provisions and adapting its legislation accordingly. The policy aims to ensure the achievement of the objectives sought, whether they are security, ecological, or socio-economic. To do this, different plans are carried out in parallel and coordinated. They must follow the calendar defined by the Confederation, as shown in the following diagram."

    "### E.4 Hydroelectric Energy Production\n\nThe Valais hydroelectric power plant portfolio stands out for its significant storage capacities, such as Lake des Dix (the largest dam lake in Switzerland), Lake d'Emosson (the second-largest in Switzerland), or Lake de Mauvoisin (the fourth-largest in Switzerland). These plants also feature steep gradients, exemplified by the 1,900-meter drop in the Bleudron conduit. Approximately two-thirds of the electricity generated comes from pumped-storage power plants (often combined with pumping stations). In addition to these large pumped-storage power plants, there are installations along the Rhône River (Ernen, Mörel, Massaboden, Chippis, Lavey), whose operation must be continued.\n\nThe untapped hydraulic potential in Valais is estimated at 5-10%. This includes both the modernization of existing installations and the construction of new facilities (see annex). Current projects along the Rhône River represent a global production potential of 270 GWh/year. Adding other development projects increases the total global production potential to approximately 680 GWh/year, excluding pumped-storage projects.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative aspect, it is also important to consider the qualitative aspect of the energy. With major dams (e.g., Grande Dixence, Emosson, Mauvoisin, Mattmark, Moiry), Valais already has significant storage capacities, some of which could be used for pumped-storage power plants. One of these installations (Nant de Drance) is currently under construction. Another cantonal pumped-storage project (Rhôdix) is in the pipeline. During the last two years of national supply shortages, a strong interest emerged for increasing winter production, for which Valais is well-prepared with its existing storage infrastructure (also the dams of Gebidem and Gries).\n\nToday, about 80% of the Valaisan hydroelectricity production capacity belongs to extracantonal owners, more than 50% to large supranational companies, and 10% to foreign enterprises. The canton's objective is to increase the control over activities in the hydroelectric value chain by public authorities and other Valais actors (e.g., energy distribution companies, pension funds, private entities).\n\nThere are also numerous small hydropower projects. In Valais, projects are announced within the framework of the feed-in tariff (RPC) for a capacity of"

A wide range of natural environments and biotopes, including alluvial zones, marshes, forests, meadows, pastures, and valuable landscapes, exist between the Rhône plain and mountain peaks. Numerous nationally prioritized species, defined by the Confederation, are present in the canton, some being very rare or endemic (e.g., snow geese). The canton thus bears a significant responsibility for nature protection at both national and international levels.\n- **Nature Protection Measures:** Nature protection encompasses all measures aimed at protecting and favoring ecosystems as habitats for flora and fauna. Rare and/or threatened species listed on Red Lists, biotopes included in national or cantonal inventories, protected biotopes according to legislation, riparian vegetation, surfaces necessary for ecological balance in intensively used territories, extensive surfaces in intensively exploited territories, artificial milieux such as ditches, canals, meadows, gravel pits, quarries, and talus with particular biological value, rare or threatened minerals, rare and representative geological sites, and certain forest reserves.\n\nThis document provides"

    "### A.9 Protection et gestion de la nature\n\n#### Context and Purpose:\nThe Confederation has set high objectives in the field of biotope and species protection. To achieve this, national lists of biotopes worthy of protection and priority species have been compiled. These objectives primarily aim to maintain and promote biodiversity, which forms the basis of our economy and quality of life.\n\n#### Federal Law on Nature and Landscape Protection (LPN):\nThe Federal Law on Nature and Landscape Protection (LPN) confers upon the Federal Council the task of drawing up inventories of nationally important objects. These inventories contain information about objects that need to be protected due to their particular beauty, rarity, importance for the image of a place, or for species protection. At the level of nature protection, the Confederation has established the following biotope inventories:\n- Sites of particular beauty;\n- High marshes and transitional marshes;\n- Low marshes;\n- Alluvial zones;\n- Frog reproduction sites;\n- Dry meadows and pastures (PPS).\n\n#### Federal Hunting and Wild Mammals and Birds Protection Act (LChP):\nUnder the Federal Hunting and Wild Mammals and Birds Protection Act (LChP), federal hunting districts are delineated by the Confederation in cooperation with the cantons. These districts can also define cantonal hunting districts in addition to federal hunting districts. The hunting districts serve to protect rare and endangered species as well as healthy populations of species that can be hunted. The conservation of species diversity and habitat preservation are guaranteed by the prohibition of hunting, regulations limiting disturbances, and provisions for habitat protection. These passive protection measures are complemented by active measures concerning the management and enhancement of biotopes, as well as measures aimed at favoring priority species.\n\n#### Federal and Cantonal Fishing Laws (LFSP and LPé):\nFishing reserves have been defined under the Federal Fishing Law (LFSP) and the Cantonal Fishing Law (LPé). These reserves serve to preserve fish species while also preserving the diversity of aquatic species and biotopes protected by the LPN.\n\n#### Switzerland as a Wintering and Resting Place for Waterfowl:\nSwitzerland plays a particularly important role as a wintering and resting place for different waterfowl species. The Federal Ordinance on Waterfowl Reserves and Migratory Bird Reserves (OROEM) ensures their protection, notably by prohibiting hunting in areas with high density and great species diversity.

    "### A.9 Nature Protection and Management\n\nThe concrete implementation of nature protection is carried out primarily through the following instruments:\n\n- **Zoning Plans (PAZ) and Local Regulations for Construction Zones (RCCZ):** Biotopes recognized as of national importance or protected by cantonal law, as well as other valuable biotopes, are assigned to a protection zone (art. 23 of the cantonal law implementing the federal law on territorial development, LoAT). The protection objectives and measures necessary for long-term conservation are contained in the corresponding RCCZ. It is opportune to distinguish between the zones and objects to protect below and indicate in each case the importance of the object (national, cantonal, communal):\n  - **Nature Protection Zone (art. 17 al. 1 of the Federal Law on Territorial Development, LAT), art. 23 LoAT:** Its purpose is the conservation and maintenance of sites presenting scientific interest or having ecological value, the protection of threatened plants and animals, as well as the preservation of their habitat. Constructions and installations are prohibited, except if they are necessary for the maintenance or exploitation of the area.\n  - **Objects to Protect (art. 17 al. 2 LAT, art. 23 al. 2 LoAT):** Natural or cultural objects of particular value are protected by adequate measures.\n\n- **Protection Decisions:** Some 45 sites have been placed under protection by the State Council. Cantonal protection decisions can be consulted on the canton's internet portal.\n\n- **Programme Agreements:** The Confederation and cantons define the services to be provided and subcontracted within nature domain programmes (e.g., species, biotopes, wetlands, ecological compensation). Communal and private institutions' nature projects can also be subsidized.\n\n- **Contractual Use Provisions:** As needed, the canton establishes contracts with operators to ensure long-term appropriate maintenance of protected objects and to compensate for ecological services of agriculture. The contracts specify the use conditions to be respected and the annual contributions paid by the Confederation and the canton.\n\n- **Fauna Tranquility Zones:** The canton has established a network of fauna tranquility zones to avoid disturbing wildlife during winter periods.\n\n- **Fauna Refuges:** These natural or artificial spaces play an important role in refuge and temporary habitat, particularly for migrating fauna.\n\n- **Information and Public Sensitization:** Relevant services regularly"

Des problèmes liés à la sécurité juridique et à l'exploitation du sol sont apparus en Valais et dans d'autres cantons alpins, vu la forte extension de la forêt. Avec le retrait progressif de l'agriculture sur les terrains à rendement marginal dans les régions de montagne et alpines, la croissance de la forêt va augmenter et la problématique de l'extension incontrôlée de la forêt s'accrue.\n\nDès 1981, le Conseil fédéral a décidé de répertorier systématiquement l'état et l'évolution de la forêt suisse et d'établir un inventaire forestier national (IFN).

It contributes to the diversity of our cultural landscape, its importance varying according to its location in urban or rural spaces.\n\nThe Federal Forest Policy 2020 ensures sustainable forest management and creates general conditions favorable to an efficient and innovative economy of forests and wood. It takes into account ecological, economic, and social requirements in the forest domain. The Confederation has set eleven objectives, including five priorities:\n1. Exploit the potential of sustainable timber exploitation.\n2. Mitigate climate change and minimize its effects on forest services through the forest and wood use.\n3. Ensure the protective function of the forest.\n4. Preserve and enhance biodiversity.\n5. Maintain forest surface area.\n\nTo implement the Confederation's Forest Policy, the Swiss Forest Program (SFP) is established. It includes a projection of the desired state of the forest, a strategy to achieve the fixed objective, and related measures and instruments. With approximately 123,000 hectares (about 23% of the cantonal territory), the forest represents a key element of the Valais landscape. Over 90% of Valais forests are in public hands and managed primarily by local and regional forestry services.\n\nForest functions are distinguished, in principle, as follows:\n- **Protection against natural dangers (forest protective function)**\n\nCurrently, nearly 87% of Valais forests have a primary protective function."

    "### A.6 Forest Functions and Management\n\n\"cost-effectiveness\" against avalanches, landslides, soil slides, and erosion. Forest management also requires preventive measures regarding threats that could disrupt their balance or existence (e.g., forest fires, damage caused by wildlife, climate change). Forest managers will promote natural forest rejuvenation through appropriate exploitation methods.\n\n- **Wood Production (e.g., construction, heating)**\nOn the cantonal territory, wood resources are significant for a growing construction and energy production market. Wood sales also contribute to financing forest protection interventions. According to the Swiss national forest inventory, the Valaisan forest has a high reserve of wood. The amount that grows annually is five times greater than the amount cut down. Large quantities of wood remain abandoned in the forest, and the forest ages. A sustainable forestry economy, oriented towards durability goals, creates conditions for better exploitation and commercialization of wood.\n\n- **Nature and Landscape (biodiversity)**\nThe forest is a vital space for fauna and flora: about 35% of all species depend on it. It also shelters nearly half of the approximately 3,550 priority species at the national level. Its management should be close to nature, favoring species diversity and improving the integration of natural habitats. Forest areas can be set aside as forest reserves to favor biological diversity and permit the natural development of the forest ecosystem. Moreover, interventions in favor of biodiversity in the forest allow the valorization of priority biotopes, the conservation of priority species, and the perpetuation of traditional forms of large value exploitation (e.g., wooded pastures, chestnut groves).\n\n- **Leisure, Relaxation, and Tourism (social)**\nWhether for leisure use (e.g., mobility trails, forest adventure paths), or as a relaxation zone, the social function of the forest is very important and contributes to the well-being of the population.\n\nPlanning is necessary to recognize and resolve potential conflicts between different forest functions. The instrument to achieve this is the cantonal forest plan. Based on forest function maps, its state, and the planned development, it sets strategic objectives for the Valaisan forest.\n\nVarious concepts address sectoral themes and determine action priorities. This is particularly the case for fire protection, forest disaster management (e.g., hurricanes, parasites), the balance between the forest and wildlife, or the reaction to climate change.\n\nSince 2008, the Confederation and the canton have concluded,"

D.5 \"Daily Soft Mobility (MDQ)\"), whose objective is to travel from point A to point B in the most direct and rapid manner possible, with pleasure, quality of traversed landscapes, and tranquility being paramount.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the Federal Law on pedestrian and cycling paths (LCPR), the Canton of Valais has had since the early 1990s a well-established and high-quality network of hiking trails. However, since the mid-1990s, the evolution of mountain biking and winter sports have led to the development of numerous trails and tracks, often punctual and uncoordinated, particularly with hiking trails - without legal basis concerning aspects of responsibility and procedures. To address this,"

    "This image is a page from a document discussing \"Mobilité douce de loisirs\" (MDL), which translates to \"Sustainable Leisure Mobility.\" It outlines two main categories of mobility: daily commuting (MDQ) and leisure mobility (MDL). \n\n### Diagram:\nThe diagram at the top of the page categorizes mobility into two types:\n1. **Quotidienne, Pendulaire (MDQ):** Daily commuting, including activities like going to school.\n   - Synergies: Goals, objectives, infrastructures.\n   - Tronçons: Segments.\n2. **Loisirs (MDL):** Leisure mobility, such as family outings.\n   - Synergies: Goals, objectives, infrastructures.\n   - Itinéraires: Routes.\n\n#### Summer (ÉTÉ):\n- Pedestrian paths\n- Bicycle lanes\n- VTT trails\n- Downhill VTT trails\n- etc.\n\n#### Winter (HIVER):\n- Hiking trails\n- Snowshoeing trails\n- Cross-country ski trails\n- etc.\n\n### Text:\nThe text below the diagram elaborates on supporting sustainable tourism within the context of MDL, emphasizing environmental preservation and balancing tourist seasons. It mentions the Canton's 2040 Mobility Concept (CCM 2040) highlighting the importance of optimizing pedestrian and VTT trail networks by 2040. The canton develops guiding concepts, distinguishing between primary pedestrian hiking trails and secondary networks, ensuring the maintenance, signage, and conservation of the cantonal cycling axis.\n\nGood coordination with promotional channels (e.g., SuisseMobile, Valais/Wallis Promotion) is also emphasized, particularly to align user demand with homologated routes. New MDL routes, especially pedestrian ones, should be carefully coordinated with existing routes and historical communication ways.\n\nPlanning phase is crucial for designing high-quality MDL networks. It defines starting points, destinations, intermediate destinations, route tracings, and structures the network coherently, coordinating with public transport interfaces. It stresses the importance of placing well-structured, attractive, and safe routes in harmony with other space uses, nature interests, landscape, agriculture, and natural danger aspects. Coordination between MDQ and MDL strategies and plans is essential. Special attention is given to route maintenance adapted to the type of route, conforming signage, and proper surface maintenance to ensure long-term benefits of existing routes.\n\n### Coordination Principles"

    "### B.6 Leisure Soft Mobility (MDL)\n\n#### 3. Planify routes so that their starting and ending points are accessible by public transport, and coordinate every new route with existing routes (e.g., other types of leisure mobility, SuisseMobile itineraries, MDQ segments, municipal networks, cantonal and neighboring countries).\n\n#### 4. Prioritize the realization of routes based on criteria related to tranquility, environmental quality, and beauty of traversed landscapes, while emphasizing the variety of routes and their continuity.\n\n#### 5. Protect sensitive areas crossed (e.g., forests, agriculture) or hosting rare or endangered species, avoid disrupting faunal corridors, and limit disturbances in francophone districts, wildlife tranquility zones, and priority wintering zones for fauna.\n\n#### 6. Encourage the conservation and restoration of historically significant paths, particularly those listed in the Federal Inventory of Historic Communication Roads of Switzerland (IVS) or whose historical importance can be proven.\n\n#### 7. Facilitate public access and free circulation along lakesides, rivers, and canals, especially at the shores of Lake Geneva and the Rhône banks.\n\n#### 8. Ensure the safety of all users (e.g., crossings, natural dangers, important traffic routes) by taking appropriate planning, organizational, and constructive measures, and implementing signage conforming to federal and cantonal norms and recommendations.\n\n#### 9. Promote harmonious coexistence among different users by taking organizational and/or constructive measures adapted, and, if necessary, separating different types of routes, particularly for safety reasons.\n\n#### 10. Maintain appropriate natural paving on pedestrian trails outside urbanized areas.\n\n---\n\n### Actions to Follow\n\n**The Canton:**\na) Develop guiding designs, notably via technical guidelines for the planning and homologation of leisure mobility routes;\nb) Coordinate with municipalities during the establishment and modification of network plans, and approve them;\nc) Classify pedestrian paths (main and secondary networks) and define, guarantee, and maintain the cantonal cycling axis;\nd) Ensure that routes are maintained and marked by municipalities, and homologates only those segments where the paving is appropriate;\ne) Maintain an inventory in a Geographic Information System (SIG) of homologated MDL networks.\n\n**The Municipalities:**\na) Plan their networks globally, considering MDQ segments, in collaboration with the canton and in accordance with federal and cantonal norms and directives;\nb) Engage an approval"

    "This image is a page from a document titled \"E.9 Décharges,\" which appears to be part of a cantonal planning document related to waste management in Switzerland. The content discusses the coordination principles for waste disposal sites, including criteria for site selection and the integration of new sites within the cantonal waste management plan (PGD).\n\n### Detailed Description:\n\n#### Section Title: Coordination\nThe section is headed \"Coordination\" and outlines several principles for managing waste disposal sites:\n\n1. **Principles**\n   - Ensure sufficient waste disposal sites across the canton's territory to limit ecological impacts and excessive emissions for the population.\n   - Promote recycling of materials and avoid disposing of those whose valorization is not ecologically or economically sustainable.\n   - Integrate waste disposal harmoniously into the surrounding landscape, favoring installations that allow the redevelopment of former material extraction sites.\n   - Authorize new waste disposal sites if they are included in the cantonal waste management plan (PGD). Existing site extensions are possible if they benefit all necessary authorizations. Exceptional authorizations for sites not listed in the PGD can be granted if a balance of ecological and economic interests among concerned parties justifies the project, given that the PGD does not identify sites in certain regions with real needs.\n   - Favor new storage sites corresponding to regional needs in accordance with principle 3. The minimum volume for future exploitation is fixed at 50,000 m³ for types A, 100,000 m³ for types B and C, and 300,000 m³ for types D and E, according to OLED art. 37 al. 1. Exceptions for minimal volumes can be considered under the conditions specified in OLED art. 3, such as the site responding to a regional need outside the Rhône plain (between Brig and Lake Geneva), meeting the conditions set out in OLED annex 2, and the origin of deposited materials being exclusively regional, referring to zones defined by the first condition above; the minimum volume available is 25,000 m³ for type A and 50,000 m³ for type B.\n   - Establish a detailed land use plan (PAD) for new types C, D, or E sites, or for types A or B with a discharge volume exceeding 500,000 m³ and significant territorial organization effects, according to LcAT"

Creating a park does not necessarily require any new protective measures. It emanates from a participatory approach by the municipalities. The purpose of a park is not to enclose a region but rather to maintain its population while favoring sustainable socio-economic activities compatible with the protection of natural and landscape spaces. The visibility gained through obtaining the \"Park\" label is an undeniable asset for the region aiming to promote a destination combining sustainable tourism and optimal valorization of the region's natural and cultural riches, agricultural products, forestry, or artisanal products.\n\nThe Federal Law on Nature and Landscape Protection (LPN) distinguishes three types of national parks:\n\n- **National Park**: A relatively large territory offering intact habitats for fauna and indigenous flora, allowing the landscape to evolve naturally.  \n- **Regional Natural Park**: A relatively vast rural territory (minimum area of 100 km²), partly inhabited and rich in natural and landscape resources. Buildings and infrastructure are particularly well integrated into the landscape. Sustainable economic development is encouraged.

    "### A.10 Natural Parks and UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\nThe Confederation encourages and financially supports regional initiatives aimed at obtaining the \"Parc\" label. One of the preconditions for acquiring this label is to develop a charter concerning park management and quality. The Confederation's aim is to support regions with high natural and landscape value that wish to orient themselves towards sustainable economic development.\n\nThe Confederation's park policy is based on the following principles:\n- Creation of a park based on a voluntary approach;\n- Implementation of a participatory democratic process with broad regional support;\n- No new protection measures necessary, except for the central areas of national parks and periurban nature parks;\n- High natural and landscape value of the region;\n- Preservation and valorization of nature and landscape, ensuring sustainable use of natural resources.\n\nValais has developed a cantonal concept for creating and managing national importance parks. Based on an evaluation of existing natural and landscape values, as well as potential economic exploitation, the concept highlights potential sites (Obergoms, Binntal, Simplon, Pfynt-Finges, Val d'Hérens, Les Follettaires – Haut-de-Cry – Derborence, Bassin des Drances, Bouveret-Grammont-Cornettes de Bise). The canton supports all local initiatives meeting the Confederation’s criteria and benefiting from widespread population support. Among the three types of national importance parks, the regional nature park is most suited to the Valais configuration. A national park could only be considered spanning one or several other cantons.\n\nThe strategic objectives of regional nature parks are as follows:\n- Preserving and valorizing the quality of nature and landscape (art. 20 OParks);\n- Strengthening economic activities based on sustainable development (art. 21 OParks);\n- Sensitization and education on sustainable development;\n- Management, communication, and territorial guarantee (art. 25, 26 al. 2 let. c and art. 27 OParks); research design and coordination (optional for regional nature parks).\n\nIn Valais, two regions have obtained the \"Parc\" label from the Confederation:\n\n**Regional Nature Park Binntal (Annex 1)**\n\nThe Regional Nature Park Binntal obtained the \"Parc\" label in July 2021 for the second time.

In the framework of the development of the management plan, the extension of the perimeter is also planned to the east and west, and improvements are envisaged on the southern side towards the Lötschental and the Lötschberg Südrampe. With the co-signature of the Charter of the Konkordiaplatz in 2005, 11 additional municipalities of the world heritage site (current status: 23 municipalities hosting the project) demonstrate their willingness to support and promote the sustainable development of the entire perimeter. The specific objectives of the SAJA are defined in the management plan of the year 2005.\n\nThe canton encourages, through financial incentives and support measures, the preservation for future generations of the site \"Alpes suisses Jungfrau-Aletsch\" inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. It collaborates with the Canton of Berne to develop and implement management plans aimed at sustainable development and the safeguarding of the SAJA site inventoried by UNESCO.\n\nOn February 23, 2016, the association Bisses du Valais submitted a dossier to the Federal Office of Culture to have the bisses inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nOther park projects have been developed but abandoned or suspended due to lack of population or community support (Simplon, Muverans, Val d'Hérens).

To achieve this, and in the context of containing infrastructure and urban development growth, it is necessary to protect the best agricultural lands, notably by classifying them as cultivated surfaces (SDA). According to Article 26 of the Land Use Ordinance (OAT), SDA consist of arable land, including open fields, artificial pastures, and natural arable grasslands.\n\nThe federal level integrates the protection of the best arable lands within a sustainable development policy, as stated in the Federal Constitution. To ensure sufficient sources of supply within the country, as per Article 1 of the Land Use Law (LAT), the Federal Council decided the Sectoral Plan for Cultivated Surfaces (PS-SDA) on April 8, 1992. The PS-SDA also contributes to quantitative soil protection, long-term preservation of good arable lands, and maintaining green spaces between buildings.\n\nPreserving fertile arable lands is also one of the strategic points defined in the Agricultural Policy, since agricultural production and public interest services depend on this essential resource. However, considerable areas continue to disappear, especially at the expense of habitat and other uses.\n\nThe figure illustrates the classification of arable land into utilizable agricultural surface (open fields, artificial pastures, natural arable grasslands without grazing) and designated and delimited as cultivated surfaces."

    "### A.2 Cultivated Surfaces\n\nThe Federal Council has thus fixed, for the entire Swiss territory, the extent of SDA to guarantee and determined their distribution among the cantons according to Art. 29 OAT. The lands classified in SDA benefit accordingly from reinforced protection.\n\nThe Canton of Valais, in agreement with the concerned municipalities and in accordance with Art. 28 OAT, circumscribed the 7'350 ha that were attributed to it through the PS-SDA and reported them on the maps. It must, in accordance with the PS-SDA, guarantee these surfaces through measures of land management despite the ongoing pressure, notably by the development of infrastructure and urbanization. However, part of the inventoried SDA is still classified in areas to be built upon, in extraction zones, or in deferred allocation zones, and is therefore not guaranteed in the long term. According to the latest data update transmitted to the Confederation on September 30, 2012, the total figure is 7'343 ha of SDA, with slightly more than 200 ha of SDA in conflict with other uses and twenty hectares of SDA losses linked to large national infrastructure projects (A9, NLFA and third Rhône correction). A new data update and a global review of the SDA situation have been carried out, in particular with the realization of the third Rhône correction project and the dimensioning of building zones. This action must also be coordinated with discussions currently underway at the national level, particularly within the framework of the revision of the PS-SDA.\n\nThe preservation of good agricultural soils holds particular strategic importance for the Canton of Valais given the contribution of the agricultural sector to the Valais economy. Beyond the initial objective of ensuring the country's food supply in case of serious crisis (e.g., ecological accidents, wars, climate disturbances), the aspect of the sustainable protection of high-quality, easily exploitable soils must now be highlighted if the Canton of Valais wishes to maintain good production conditions for its agriculture. Finally, the increasing pressure of urbanization on agricultural lands as well as the realization of large public or private projects necessitates great attention from the Canton on the issue of maintaining good agricultural soils. The Canton encourages reflections at the supramunicipal, regional, or agglomeration levels concerning the SDA to resolve the compensation question for large projects.\n\nThe Canton must show"

The characteristic relief of the Alpine valleys exposes these areas to risks of all types of gravity. The potential for damage related to flood phenomena is also present, especially in the Rhône plain. The occurrence of natural hazards is closely dependent on the evolution of climate change in mountain regions. It should not be forgotten that Valais is also one of the cantons most exposed in Switzerland to seismic risk. To ensure adequate protection and put in place appropriate strategies for managing territory, the canton of Valais identifies the different types of natural hazards that are:\n- Hydrological dangers: floods, inundations, torrential flows, erosion of banks and alluvial deposits, landslides;\n- Geological dangers: slope instability (landslides, settlements, collapses, mudflows, rockfalls) and earthquakes;\n- Nival-glacial dangers: avalanches and serac falls.\n\nIn Switzerland, the CENAL is a federal organ specialized in the management of extraordinary events, which ensures a 24-hour presence over 24 and 365 days per year, allowing it to intervene quickly. The CENAL thus acts as the first point of contact for cantons regarding"

    "This image is a page from a document discussing natural hazards and risk reduction measures in the canton of Valais, Switzerland. It is part of a larger document titled \"A.16 Dangers naturels\" (Natural Hazards).\n\n### Content Summary:\nThe document outlines the measures taken by the canton of Valais to address natural hazards, particularly focusing on flood risks related to the Rhône River. It mentions the development of hazard zones and the establishment of protection objectives for different categories of objects, taking into account the probability of events occurring.\n\n#### Key Points:\n- **Specific Case of Rhône Flood Risk:** The canton of Valais developed and published public consultation projects for the Rhône flood hazard zones in June 2011, including restrictions on property rights and construction requirements in these zones.\n- **Seismic Risk:** Based on the national seismic risk map included in SIA 261, the Valais region is the most exposed to seismic risk in Switzerland. Effective protective measures against this type of danger are only parasismic constructions, which are regulated by cantonal construction legislation.\n- **Cantonal Earthquake Preparedness and Intervention Concept (COCPITT):** In September 2013, the cantonal Council of State decided to implement the COCPITT concept, aiming to promote the establishment of cantonal and communal emergency plans for earthquakes in the coming years. Support for this implementation is provided by the SSCM and SFCEP.\n- **Risk Reduction Measures:** To reduce the risk posed by natural hazards, three categories of measures are established:\n  1. **Passive Measures (Territorial Planning):**\n     - Exclusion of the most threatened sectors (if necessary, rezoning).\n     - Construction and land use prescriptions.\n  2. **Active Measures:**\n     - Constructive measures.\n     - Forestry measures.\n     - Maintenance.\n  3. **Organizational Measures:**\n     - Cantonal network of observation and alert.\n     - Evacuation plans.\n     - Cantonal coordination body (OCC) and communal and regional state major commands (EMC-EMCR).\n     - Temporary protection measures.\n\n### Diagram Description:\nThe diagram illustrates the three categories of risk reduction measures:\n- **Category 1 (Mesures passives):** Includes territorial planning measures like exclusion of high-risk areas and construction and land use prescriptions.\n- **Category 2 (Mesures actives):** Com"

    "### A.16 Natural Hazards\n\n#### Level of Danger\n\n| Degree | Construction Regulation |\n|--------|-------------------------|\n| Red - High | In principle, prohibition of all construction. An assessment of the entire area may allow for conditional opening prior to construction. |\n| Blue - Medium | Construction possible based on a technical expertise that the applicant must produce during the authorization request, specifying the construction measures taken to reduce the risk. |\n| Yellow - Low | Construction possible based on the cantonal service's forecast setting the loads and protection conditions, generally individual. |\n| Yellow Striped - Residual | Construction authorized depending on the classes of works fixed by SIA norms or potentially according to the density ratio. The cantonal authority's forecast sets the loads and protection conditions. In the case of hydrological danger, we will avoid the construction of works that prevent residual flow in the risk management corridor (e.g., transverse dams). |\n\nExemptions may be granted only for constructions and installations whose location is linked to a determined place, and for safety reasons allowing to reduce the risk.\n\nDanger zones projects are elaborated and put to public inquiry by the municipal council. They consist of plans, prescriptions, and a technical report. The procedure for approving danger zones follows the provisions of art. 16 ss. of the Canton Law on the Management of Waterways (LcACE).\n\nOnce entered into force, danger zones are reported as indicative (art. 11 al. 3 of the Canton Law on the Application of Federal Law on Territorial Planning (LcATI)) in the zone allocation plan (PAZ). The communal regulations on buildings and zones (RCCZ) contain a general article on natural hazards. Danger zones have a preponderance over the zones of allocation (e.g., exclusion of building zones in red areas). The municipality will assess the need to adapt its PAZ. The essential consequence is that no construction may be authorized in high-risk zones. An assessment of the entire area may allow for conditional opening prior to construction. According to art. 36 of the Canton Ordinance on Buildings, all requests for construction within the defined perimeters of natural hazards must be transmitted to the cantonal construction secretariat, which will consult specialized organs (responsible services).\n\n2) Active Measures\n\nActive measures aim to reduce risks and potential damages, giving priority to the maintenance of protective forests, water courses, and existing protection works. In addition, construction"

    "### A.16 Natural Hazards\n\nThe OCC establishes the decision-making bases necessary for governmental activities and supports the State Council for direction, coordination, and execution of emergency measures. Following the floods of 1993 and 2000, the CERISE was established and integrated into the OCC. In case of mobilization of the cantonal or regional command centers, the OCC will provide support upon request by the local authorities. These authorities will be encouraged to take urgent intervention decisions, including population evacuation and closure of communication routes. CERISE relies primarily on analyses it conducts using cantonal surveillance-alarm and risk management systems (e.g., the Minerve system allowing collaboration with dam operators during floods), as well as data provided by federal organs and offices.\n\nTo offer the best possible protection against natural hazards, all concerned actors will be integrated into an integrated planning and global risk management process.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n1. Ensure comprehensive risk management by identifying natural hazards, evaluating potential damages, defining challenges, planning passive, active, and organizational measures, and periodically reviewing the situation of dangers and measures taken.\n2. Limit human activities within natural hazard perimeters through land-use planning measures according to applicable rules for each type of danger.\n3. Protect human activity zones and infrastructure (e.g., roads, railway lines), particularly through maintenance measures (e.g., water maintenance and renaturation, forest conservation, proper material management) and construction measures.\n4. Ensure sustainable protection of people and assets located in the Rhône plain by implementing land-use planning measures as stipulated by the PA-R3.\n5. Establish organizational intervention measures in case of extreme events.\n6. Coordinate emergency measures in case of particular and extraordinary situations at the cantonal and communal levels.\n7. Sensitize the population and all other actors to different types of natural hazards."

    "### D.4 Road Networks\n\nAt the federal level, a global transport strategy is included in the Sectoral Transport Plan (PST) – Part Programme, which sets out the objectives, principles, and priorities of the Confederation concerning its transport infrastructure, particularly railways and roads. The sectoral plan also defines how to coordinate measures related to different modes of transport among themselves and with the desired territorial development, emphasizing safety and environmental aspects. National road infrastructures are necessary to guarantee several functions, including ensuring international transit traffic passage, connecting large and medium-sized urban agglomerations, serving major alpine regions, or ensuring basic service areas in peripheral regions.\n\nOn February 12, 2017, the creation of a fund for national roads and urban traffic (FORTA) was accepted by the people and cantons. This fund allows the Confederation to continue investing in the operation, maintenance, and development of national roads, to continue its financial contributions to the main Swiss roads, properties of the cantons, and to continue providing sufficient financial aid to urban projects.\n\nOne of the strong objectives of transport policy in Valais is to ensure and improve the coverage of the entire cantonal territory. Four complementary strategic action fields have been defined:\n- Daily movements within and towards agglomerations;\n- National and international connections;\n- Service to tourist centers;\n- Service to peripheral zones.\n\nThis objective requires the construction and improvement of an important road network, as well as its security, maintenance, and upkeep (Annex 1). Moreover, certain trends, notably the expansion of building zones, the growth of traffic volume, or the increase in vehicle dimensions, imply an increase in the surface allocated to road networks (+15% between 1985 and 2009 in Switzerland). At this point, it is necessary to actively include the development and management of the road network in territorial reflections, given the strong links between the development of transport infrastructure and territorial development.\n\nIn the perspective of sustainable development, the Canton of Valais commits itself to implementing measures aimed at optimizing movements before optimizing them. This is envisaged through effective coordination between the development of urbanization (residences, work posts, consumer goods offers, public services, leisure activities) and mobility. The emphasis must be placed on measures of land use planning. It is also possible to act on the number of movements by financial incentives (e.g., fiscal and tariff policies). It is also indispensable to seek a modal shift of"

Transfer, to the extent possible given topographical and economic conditions, part of the individual motorized traffic on TP and MD.\n6. Qualitatively plan local crossings, taking into account traffic fluidity and road safety in the elaboration of public space projects of quality (e.g., reserved lanes, meeting zones).\n7.

Article 9 al. 1 of the Secondary Residences Act allows these elements within buildings protected within the building zone, even if the municipality has a secondary residence rate exceeding 20%.\n\nPreservation of the identity elements of a place remains the primary objective, and damage to items listed in inventories must remain exceptional. Situations encountered on-site are examined case by case, and a complete analysis of interests must be conducted. Coordination of planning and project implementation among concerned actors is therefore indispensable.\n\nProtecting heritage depends on knowledge and recognition of it, which requires coherent policies in surveillance, protection, and inventories (methods used, updated) and public information and awareness campaigns so that the population can appropriate and defend this heritage.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n1. Ensure, through adequate planning and coordination measures (inventory, classification, protection, then inscription in the cantonal development plan and zone allocation plans (PAZ)), the preservation and valorization of constructed sites (ISOS), archaeological sites, historical communication routes (IVS), cultural assets, and buildings worthy of protection inscribed in federal, cantonal, and communal inventories, and maintain, if the balance of interests allows, the qualities that led to the classification of these objects (situation, spatial and historic-architectural characteristics).\n2. Regularly update cantonal and communal inventories to integrate more recent heritage and newly protected archaeological sectors.\n3. Support the conservation, restoration, and valorization of protected objects through expert councils and subsidies, taking into account the site and object classification.\n4. Ensure the homogeneity of constructions (e.g., facades, roofs) in old villages and hamlets, considering local and regional protection objectives and particularities, especially concerning roofing and materials used.\n5. Preserve the built substance and, if necessary, authorize changes in the use of protected buildings if their original function is no longer possible and no overriding interest prevents it, while respecting protection objectives and preserving their essential exterior aspect, architectural structure, and surroundings.\n6. Ensure the conservation and valorization of apparent or buried archaeological vestiges and, in case of necessity for evacuation, conduct a survey, documentation, and study of threatened structures.\n\n### To Follow\n\nThe canton:\na) ensures, within the framework of planning procedures,"

Here's a detailed breakdown of its content:\n\n### Title and Context\n- **Title**: E.3 Approvisionnement en énergie (Energy Supply)\n- **Date of Decision**: 14.06.2017\n- **Adoption by Grand Conseil**: 08.03.2018\n- **Approval by Confederation**: 01.05.2019\n- **Interaction with Fiches**: D.1, E.1, E.4, E.5, E.6, E.7\n\n### Strategic Development Strategy\n- **Objective 5.1**: Create conditions favorable for indigenous and renewable energy production and waste heat valorization.\n- **Objective 5.2**: Reduce resource and energy consumption.\n- **Objective 5.3**: Optimize infrastructure for supply and waste disposal.\n- **Objective 5.4**: Promote integrated water management.\n\n### Instances\n- **Responsible**: SEFH (Swiss Federal Office for Energy)\n- **Concerned Parties**: \n  - Confederation\n  - Canton: SBMA, SCA, SCPF, SDM, SDT, SEN, SFCEP\n  - Municipalities: All\n  - Others: Energy supply and production companies\n\n### Context\n- **Global Energy Consumption**: Increased global energy consumption over recent decades has led to awareness about the depletion of fossil energy resources and the environmental impacts of energy agents (air, water, soil, noise, non-ionizing radiation), as well as individual health effects depending on exploitation modes. Excessive fossil energy agent emissions, such as CO₂, are no longer negligible compared to natural cycles and influence climate evolution. Economic security is threatened by high dependence on imported non-renewable energies.\n- **Energy Policy**: Since 1990, Switzerland, like other industrialized nations, has strengthened its energy policy primarily focusing on energy efficiency and renewable energy reinforcement. Despite federal efforts under Energie2000 and SuisseEnergie programs, and intercantonal cohesion in applying energy programs, global energy consumption stabilization was achieved for the first time since 1990. Energy supply depends on approximately 80% imports, mainly fossil fuels and nuclear fuels, without renewable"

    "### E.3 Energy Supply\n\nEnergy consumption is covered by fossil fuel imports at 65%. Electricity consumption, representing 27% of cantonal energy consumption, comes from 22% of Swiss renewable production according to 2010 labeling declarations.\n\nValais' energy production mainly comes from hydroelectric power, which averaged 9,400 GWh annually over the decade 2001-2010, accounting for about 26% of Switzerland's hydroelectric production and 15% of national electricity production. Incineration plants (UIOM) produce around 180 GWh of electricity per year and generate three times more heat. However, this heat is currently underutilized, primarily for distant heating. Solar, wind, wood, biomass energy, and heat rejection contribute to the canton's electricity and heating needs. In geothermal energy, the canton plans to develop legislation to coordinate underground resource utilization.\n\nCommunes conduct energy audits on their territory, defining targeted objectives and priorities in energy supply, then establishing territorial energy planning. SuisseEnergie plays a major role in achieving federal and cantonal energy policy goals. For example, within its activities \"SuisseEnergie for Communes\" and \"SuisseEnergie for Infrastructure,\" numerous communes have received the \"Energy City\" label since 2017. Over 60% of Valais residents now live in an Energy City.\n\nCantonal objectives align with national and international contexts while considering specific demand and supply characteristics. By 2020, the canton aims to reduce fossil fuel needs by 18.5%, stabilize electricity consumption at 2,370 GWh, increase indigenous renewable and heat rejection energy production to 1,400 GWh, and improve energy value chain activities. Together, these objectives aim for secure and economic energy supply and use.\n\nIn 2020, cantonal final energy consumption should decrease by 600 GWh compared to 2010, reaching 11,400 GWh despite population and economic growth. If cantonal 2020 targets are met, the share of fossil fuels in total cantonal final energy consumption will be reduced from 65% to 59%. Increased use of Valais indigenous resources would boost production by approximately 10% by 2020.\n\nElectricity production should rise"

These include administrative centers (e.g., post offices, banks), small commercial centers under 2000 m², schools, hospitals, long-term care facilities (e.g., medical-social centers, elderly care homes, day care centers), sports and cultural infrastructures of communal or regional importance, and asylum centers. Public interest installations are primarily businesses and infrastructures offering minimal services, particularly in smaller municipalities. They contribute to creating attractive, competitive, and networked centers at local, supramunicipal, and regional levels.\n\nImportant installations generating significant traffic (IGT) like transport interfaces (e.g., train stations, Park&Ride), travel parking areas, economic activity zones, and urban public spaces are discussed in other cantonal directorate sheets.\n\nGenerally, Valais municipalities are well-served by public interest installation services. However, due to various reasons (e.g., population decline, financial difficulties), maintaining minimal service offerings is no longer guaranteed in an increasing number of villages and municipalities. To preserve good attractiveness and appropriate urbanization structures, municipalities and villages with over 250 inhabitants should ideally have a minimum offer of public interest installation services, including daily consumption goods, postal and banking services, health-related services, and restaurants.

In 2001, the canton had 27 villages with more than 250 inhabitants without such shops. Ten years later, the number increased to 33 villages. The decline of shops offering daily consumption goods in mountain regions and the concentration of sales surfaces in peri-urban areas reflects the cantonal policy and spatial development goals regarding provisioning. This development has favored motorized populations over those who do not drive in accessing daily consumption goods.\n\n### Education Sector\nThe canton of Valais encourages the grouping and networking of educational institutions (compulsory education, specialized education, secondary general education) to facilitate administrative management and pedagogical conduct. It collaborates closely with local authorities and municipalities, particularly focusing on maintaining links between regions and sectors to meet the needs and expectations of students at each educational cycle. The cantonal strategy also aims to maintain compulsory schools in remote communes.\n\n### Healthcare Planning\nThe canton’s healthcare policy aims to optimize coordination between hospital planning and long-term care. In 2004, the Valais Health Network observed a significant change in hospital planning, which allowed reducing the number of hospital beds due to shorter average stays and increasing the number of EMS beds, especially in the two central health regions of the canton. To avoid regional disparities, it is essential to maintain a positive correlation between the number of elderly people and the number of available EMS beds in each of the six health regions of the canton.\n\n### Sports Policy\nThe canton supports the population, especially young people, in practicing regular sports activities through adapted installations and infrastructure. Improvements, such as renovation of current facilities and construction of additional infrastructure, are necessary. For example, the lack of sports teaching rooms in professional training centers has been addressed by building modern infrastructures in collaboration with the host communes. Other supra-communal sports infrastructures, including a minimum double room with bleachers, could be implemented"

    "### C.8 Public Interest Installations\n\nThe needs for public interest installations are closely linked to the cantonal demographic projections, which anticipate a general aging of the population along with regional differentiation in growth rates. To anticipate these needs and meet demand, it is necessary to conduct active planning aimed at improving access to public interest installations, valuing the multifunctionality of infrastructure, and strengthening intermunicipal collaboration within projects.\n\n#### Coordination\n\n##### Principles\n1. Promote a concentrated and hierarchical policy for public interest installations, distributing them according to local, supramunicipal, and regional needs.\n2. Locate public interest installations within or near urban sectors, preserving the quality of life for residents.\n3. Ensure a minimal and sufficient supply of daily consumption goods and public interest services to the entire population by encouraging intermunicipal or multifunctional installations.\n4. Allow the entire population, including those with reduced mobility, to easily access public interest installations by favoring eco-friendly modes of transport (e.g., public transportation, cycling, walking).\n5. Favor the expansion, transformation, or repurposing of existing buildings before constructing new public interest installations.\n6. Encourage, when they are suitable, the rehabilitation of industrial sites or the repurposing of old military infrastructures for the installation of public interest installations.\n\n##### Actions to Follow\n\nThe canton:\na) favors a concentrated and hierarchical decentralization policy, taking into account local, supramunicipal, and regional needs, particularly for its own subsidized public interest installations;\nb) encourages the use and realization of intermunicipal public interest installations, as well as the multifunctional services of public interest;\nc) commits to coordinated and efficient use of supramunicipal and regional installations, and works with all partners to find an appropriate location in line with the desired spatial development;\nd) ensures, through agreements with municipalities and other partners, good accessibility to public interest installations;\ne) examines, for its own public interest installations, the opportunity to use or repurpose existing buildings before building new ones;\nf) analyzes, in coordination with the Confederation, the possibility of repurposing old military infrastructures for the installation of public interest installations and informs the concerned municipalities accordingly."

    "This document is part of a cantonal development strategy for the Canton of Valais, Switzerland, focusing on vineyards (\"Vignes\"). It outlines the context, objectives, and actions related to the development and protection of vineyards within the canton's territory. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Title and Context\n- **Title**: A.3 Vignes\n- **Date of Decision**: 14.06.2017\n- **Adoption by Grand Conseil**: 08.03.2018\n- **Approval by Confederation**: 01.05.2019\n- **Interaction with Fiches**: A.1, A.2, A.4, A.8\n\n### Strategic Development Strategy\nThe document outlines three key strategic objectives under the broader framework of territorial development:\n1. **1.1: Create conditions favorable for diversified and competitive agriculture**\n2. **1.3: Maintain biodiversity and strengthen the ecological network**\n3. **1.4: Preserve natural and cultural landscapes**\n\n### Instances\n- **Responsible**: SCA (Swiss Confederation)\n- **Concerned**: \n  - Federal level: Confederation\n  - Cantonal level: SAJMTE, SDT, SEN, SFCEP\n  - Municipalities: All\n  - Others: Not specified\n\n### Context\n- **Value of Vineyards**: Vineyards are traditional agricultural surfaces that contribute to the cultural landscape, ecology, and tourism of the Valais region. They hold significant cultural value due to their historical farming practices (e.g., terraced vineyards, dry stone walls).\n- **Challenges**: Vineyards face competition from foreign products at lower prices, affecting the local wine market. The economic importance of vineyards lies in their role as a major driver of agricultural activities in Valais. However, they compete with other land uses (e.g., building zones, extraction areas, nature protection zones) that are incompatible with viticulture.\n- **Economic Challenges**: The income from grape cultivation is insufficient to cover operational costs, leading to reduced production quality and diversification of grape varieties.\n- **Production Area Protection**: To ensure a sustainable supply of high-quality grapes, critical production areas need to be preserved. This involves establishing protected production zones and delineating appellation areas. A cantonal viticultural cadastre has been set up, distinguishing between vineyard areas and"

    "### A.3 Vineyards\n\nStabilization occurs after more than a decade of conversion characterized by a reduction in white grape surface area in favor of red grapes and partial replacement of main grape varieties (pinot noir, gamay, and chasselas) by renowned autochthonous grape varieties.\n\nMechanization continues to progress, leading to different and new cultural modes. These advances bring about new investments and economic requirements regarding agricultural productivity. Current infrastructures are no longer strongly adapted to needs, and structural improvements must open up new possibilities while respecting the landscape and tradition.\n\nThe slope, mainly on the right bank of the Rhône, is cultivated with vines in terraces supported by dry stone walls that facilitate its cultivation and offer an attractive landscape. However, terrace cultures, labor-intensive, are expensive, and the walls tend to deteriorate. One of the concerns of land improvements is to support future maintenance and restoration of these works. The steps of the conservation of dry stone walls consist in determining the vineyard landscape identity to protect, point out each retained interest, and determine the importance of the improvement perimeter. It is then important to define more prescriptions of protection (e.g., preservation of terraces, traditional cultures, types of construction).\n\nThe challenge for Valais viticulture aims to improve coherence between the type of grape and the terroir to move towards quality production, thus making greater mechanization possible to ensure the development of vineyard productivity. Meanwhile, maintaining the quality of the landscape linked to the conservation of dry stone walls is essential to ensure the promotion, tourist, and cultural assets of the Valaisan vineyard.\n\n\\section*{Coordination}\n\n\\subsection*{Principles}\n\n1. Ensure over the long term a sufficient and minimal area of vineyard production to maintain a competitive vineyard.\n2. Maintain the essential characteristics of rural landscapes, particularly terraces and dry stone walls.\n3. Allow, through structural improvements, intensive agricultural development in line with farming methods and traditional forms of viticulture.\n4. Promote the development of complementary economic activities to viticultural activities (e.g., production and sale of terroir products, agrotourism).\n5. Preserve and promote biodiversity in vineyards (e.g., hedges and woodlands, partial soil enrichment).\n6.

It is the largest in Switzerland with 65 establishments, representing 15% of Swiss campsites. In 2014, approximately 380,000 nights were recorded, which constitutes a significant part of the total number of structured accommodation nights. Campings are mainly located at low altitude, and 75% are in the Rhône plain.\n\nCamping, in various forms, represents an alternative to traditional vacations in hotels or apartments. In the context of competition among different forms of accommodation, camping occupies a privileged place due to its cost advantages.\n\nExisting structures are however saturated during July and August, periods during which 70% of the nights are concentrated. The offer is therefore periodically insufficient, and the demand exceeds supply. The creation of \"buffer sectors,\" usable in July and August near existing installations, could absorb this excess demand.\n\nTraditional camping is divided into four types: rural, passage, mixed, and residential.\n- **Rural camping:** This type of accommodation prioritizes the natural aspect and allows seasonal stays in nature with rudimentary equipment and much space. Shelters are tents on the ground. Complementary infrastructures (sanitary facilities) are grouped in an existing construction nearby (e.g., farm, meadow). During off-season, agricultural activity resumes.

In the plains and on the slopes, the great variety of agricultural land use shapes and structures the Valais landscape: on one hand, the fields, high-tillage orchards, meadows, and vineyards form the essence of traditional rural landscapes; on the other hand, fruit cultures and arable lands compose the typical image of the Rhône plain. Although building land reserves are sufficient, pressure on agricultural lands, particularly on arable land surfaces (SDA), is high, especially in the Rhône plain.\n\nMountain agriculture is also an important component of the Valais agricultural landscape. The preservation of agricultural lands in the mountains plays a significant role in avoiding the abandonment of soils where profitability is highest. This abandonment could lead to negative effects, notably on agricultural production potential (meat and dairy products) in terms of natural risks, species diversity, and landscapes, and consequently, on tourism attractiveness. It is therefore crucial to support mountain agriculture, whether it is carried out professionally or as a hobby.\n\nAgriculture is a central activity for the organization and maintenance of the cantonal territory's landscape. It is multifunctional, ensuring agricultural production, guaranteeing basic product supplies, contributing to maintaining decentralized production and crop diversity, and preserving the beauty of the landscape.\n\nThe agricultural use of land frequently conflicts with other interests (e.g., building zones, golf courses, extraction and deposition zones of materials, nature and landscape protection zones, transport infrastructure, water protection),"

The categories are:\n- Habitat et emplois (Housing and employment)\n- Transports (Transport)\n- Industrie (Industry)\n- Agriculture intensive (Intensive agriculture)\n- Rhône (Rhône River)\n- Agriculture extensive (Extensive agriculture)\n- Végétation imprductive (Unproductive vegetation)\n- Alpages (Alpine pastures)\n- Forêts (Forests)\n\nThe chart visually compares the changes in land use under both scenarios, showing the impact on different sectors.\n\n### Textual Content:\nThe text explains the evolution of agricultural economics and the importance of diversifying agricultural activities to enhance rural vitality and attractiveness. It mentions the policy framework (PA 2018-2021) aimed at encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship in agriculture and the food chain. The text also references the Federal Law on Territorial Planning (LcAT) and the need to differentiate agricultural zones into four types:\n1. **Zone agricole I**: Areas particularly suited for agriculture, including surfaces for viticulture and mechanized farming.\n2. **Zone agricole II**: Agricultural surfaces used in the general interest, often characterized by steep slopes, limited soil depth, or difficult climatic conditions, such as alpine pastures.\n3. **Zone agricole protégée**: Protected agricultural areas preserved for their quality, aesthetic value, traditional structures, and important rural landscapes. The primary focus remains on agriculture, distinguishing these from protection zones like nature reserves.\n4. **Zone agricole spéciale**: Special agricultural zones, typically found in plains and lateral valleys, necessary to maintain agricultural activity not entirely dependent on soil or for horticulture production (e.g., out-of-soil cultures).\n\nThe document concludes with a note about the location and size of these special agricultural zones being subject to further discussion."

The concrete possibilities of using this zone will be determined in a detailed land-use plan (PAD).\n\nIn the future, agricultural enterprises will need to diversify their activities and adapt increasingly to market needs, as well as societal expectations. To maintain sufficient revenues in agricultural operations – particularly in mountain regions – it is necessary to recognize and admit more compatible related activities. In Valais, this diversification can notably be achieved through activities such as energy production (solar, biomass) or agrotourism services.\n\nDue to the decentralized production structure, agriculture contributes significantly to the decentralized occupation of the territory. Traditional agricultural surfaces exploited and agricultural constructions and installations possess great landscape, ecological, and cultural value. These diversified traditional agricultural landscapes (meadows, vineyards, high-twig orchards, pastures, hedges, cultures, and coteau gardens) also have a tourist appeal. Maintaining and developing these traditional agricultural modes structuring the characteristic landscapes that result from them constitutes an important issue for Valais. In this sense, it is equally important to preserve and valorize existing traditional agricultural constructions and installations and to allow their adaptations and transformations for accessory non-agricultural activities (e.g., production and sale of products of the soil, artisanal activities, agrotourism services, sociotherapeutic or pedagogical services – art. 40 of the Territorial Land Use Ordinance (OAT)) or the detention of horses and animals for leisure purposes (art. 34b OAT).\n\nThus, it is indispensable to reinforce the synergies between agriculture and other economic activity sectors such as tourism, energy production, and forestry, in order to guarantee the maintenance and development of Valaisian agricultural production.

Structural improvements preserve the richness of the agricultural, cultural, landscape, and environmental heritage. Generally, structural policy promotes rational and sustainable development of production structures in rural areas, as well as in matters of rural engineering (e.g., regional development projects, agricultural planning, parcel rearrangements, roads, walls, irrigation, ditches) and rural construction (e.g., farm buildings, alpine structures).\n\nAgricultural structural improvements are also necessary to accompany the realization of projects such as the construction of new transport infrastructure (A9), the third Rhône correction project, and other water management and river restoration projects. Structural improvements help to distribute, mutualize, and minimize the impact of these large projects on farmland and agricultural enterprises.\n\nThe federal agricultural policy focuses on improving competitiveness and sustainability. Structural improvements create optimal and durable structures indispensable to fulfilling the constitutional mandate of multifunctionality assigned to agriculture. They aim to improve farming bases to reduce production costs and enhance economic and rural living conditions.\n\nValaisan agriculture contributes significantly to maintaining a diverse landscape.

    "### A.4 Structural Improvements\n\nThe underutilization of marginal land, forest growth, and the encroachment of building sites on the best agricultural lands pose major problems on the slopes and in the side valleys. In the alpine regions, the decline of agriculture leads to the progressive abandonment of buildings and infrastructure. To reverse this trend, several instruments allow for planning and implementing structural improvement measures:\n\n- Agricultural plans (PA): Anniviers, Sierre-Chippis-Chalais-Grône;\n- Regional development projects (PDR): Saastal, Agro-Espace Leuk-Raron, Anniviers, Hérens, Entremont, Val d'Illiez;\n- Land improvements (parcellary rearrangements) and alpine improvements;\n- Farming rearrangements: Lotschental, etc.;\n- Periodic maintenance of agricultural infrastructure (REP): maintaining vineyards in terraces, improving roads and agricultural paths, and bisses, etc.\n\nThese structural improvement measures include:\n\n- Agricultural constructions, renovations, or drainage networks, irrigation networks, dry stone walls, etc.;\n- Maintenance of useful agricultural surfaces;\n- Rural construction, renovation, or drainage of rural buildings and alpine buildings;\n- Agritourism or oenotourism projects.\n\nIn flat regions, large infrastructure projects (e.g., A9, third Rhône correction, river renaturation, and watercourse corrections, flood reduction basins) have significant impacts on productive agricultural lands. They put severe pressure on agricultural operations and production structures. Structural improvements aim to distribute and mutualize the consequences of these large projects on farmed lands and agricultural enterprises.\n\nIn the future, the Valaisan structural policy will focus its objectives on appropriate land management, adaptation to climate change, and the fight against撂荒 and forest expansion. A strong emphasis will be placed on intercommunal and supraregional collaboration. Projects involving measures aimed at creating added value in agriculture will be favored. These projects will strengthen the collaboration between agriculture and related sectors and ensure authentic agricultural production.\n\nStructural improvement projects will prioritize agricultural interests above all else, while also considering territorial development objectives, economic goals, natural hazard protection, forest management, nature conservation, landscape, water, and environmental protection. Planned structural improvements constitute an adequate instrument to respect, as much as possible, all interests related to coordinated regional development.\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n\n1.

They rent spaces annually and are registered with local authorities. Transit areas serve short-term stops (maximum three weeks) during mutation periods (March to October). These areas need daily infrastructure.\n- **Challenges**: Nomadic people face difficulties finding parking spaces in Switzerland due to their independent livelihoods and client service activities. They also encounter conflicts with local authorities and issues of cohabitation with settled populations, particularly during large-scale movements.\n- **Legal Framework**: According to Article 3 of the Federal Law on Territorial Planning (LAT), reserved territories for housing and economic activities must be developed according to population needs. The Federal Tribunal confirmed in 2003 (ATF 129 II 321) that the right to preserve cultural identity is guaranteed by the Constitution and international law, and that nomadic people's needs must be considered within territorial planning regulations. Therefore, collaboration among federal, cantonal, and municipal levels continues to plan parking areas.\n\n#### Additional Information:\n-"

Plan three parking areas on the cantonal territory, one in Lower Valais, one in Central Valais, and one in Upper Valais.\n2. Put into service the missing parking areas (two 40-place areas each in Central Valais and Upper Valais) for travellers on suitable sites in the Rhône plain, qualitatively improve the 40 places of the Martigny transit area, and ensure the sustainability of these areas.\n3. Promote the multifunctional use of parking areas for travellers.\n4. Establish a convention between the canton and the concerned communes to fix the key for cost distribution and ensure optimal management of parking areas for travellers.\n5. Facilitate, during spontaneous stops, contact between travellers and the owner or user of a private plot, provided that the latter has given their consent and no public interest is involved.\n\n#### Actions to Follow\n\n**The canton:**\na) indicates, in close coordination and consultation with the communes, the sites suitable for the installation of parking areas for travellers;\nb) analyzes, in coordination with the Confederation, the possibility of reallocating former military lands for the installation of parking areas for travellers;\nc) seeks opportunities to create synergy between parking areas for travellers and other public infrastructure (e.g., highway areas, car parks);\nd) informs and sensitizes the communes about the needs of travellers, in collaboration with the concerned partners;\ne) collaborates with neighboring cantons in planning and security matters related to the theme of travellers;\nf) elaborates, in collaboration with the concerned communes, a regulation governing the operation applicable to the reception of travellers on the parking areas;\ng) supports the communal prescriptions that facilitate spontaneous halts of travellers following the owner's or user's agreement.\n\n**The communes:**\na) delineate, during the adaptation of their zone allocation plan, an adequate zone (general interest zone) for a reserved parking area for travellers and fix the provisions thereof in the communal construction and zone regulations;\nb) informs and sensitizes the population about the needs of travellers, in collaboration with the concerned partners;"

    "This document is part of a cantonal development strategy for cable transport infrastructure in the Canton of Valais, Switzerland. It outlines the context, strategic goals, and responsible instances for the development of cable transport systems. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Title and Context\n- **Title**: D.6 Infrastructures de transport public par câble (Cable Public Transport Infrastructure)\n- **Date of Decision**: 14.06.2017\n- **Adoption by Grand Conseil**: 08.03.2018\n- **Approval by Confederation**: 01.05.2019\n- **Interaction with Fiches**: B.1, B.4, D.1, D.2, D.3, D.4, D.5, E.3\n\n### Strategic Development Strategy\n#### Objectives\n- **2.2**: Encourage the international competitiveness of alpine tourist centers.\n- **3.1**: Maintain functions and resident populations in villages and municipalities.\n- **4.2**: Ensure reliable and efficient transport services for all Valaisan communes towards the centers.\n- **4.3**: Implement a performance, economic, and environmentally friendly public transport offer.\n\n### Instances\n- **Responsible**: SDM (likely referring to a specific department or body within the Canton of Valais).\n- **Concerned Parties**: \n  - Confederation\n  - Canton: SDANA, SDT, SEFH, SEN, SETI, SFNP, SIP\n  - Municipalities: All\n  - Others: Concerned companies\n\n### Context\n- Mid-20th century saw the development of cable cars and funiculars to connect high-altitude villages due to the lack of road access and low car ownership.\n- With the advent of well-performing and comfortable road networks, cable transport installations have become complementary to roads.\n- In 2015, 22 installations, including 7 managed by the Canton, provided public transport links between the plain and the mountains.\n- Despite the necessity of cable transport in certain topographically challenging areas, its current use is under pressure, particularly regarding public transport connectivity along the installation route.\n- Cable transport is often considered for public transport connections due to its advantages, such as speed, safety, capacity, and long lifespan.\n- Economically, cable transport is more cost-effective than public road transport.\n-"

    "### D.6 Cable Public Transport Infrastructures\n\nIn addition, due to the residents' and tourists' demand for rapid public transport links to mountain villages, tourist stations, and ski areas, the development of new cable transport installations constitutes an interesting option. On one hand, the attractiveness of mountain regions for habitation can be significantly increased by connecting these areas to intermodal transport hubs in the Rhône plain or directly to agglomerations, major employment centers. On the other hand, these public transport links are also attractive to tourists, especially when they connect directly to ski areas. This tourism component becomes increasingly inseparable from the public utility of transport, thus conferring a dual function on the cable installations.\n\nMoreover, new cable links offer the advantage of a relatively small footprint on the territory, given their superior capacity for traffic flow. In terms of urbanization, the development of new cable links goes hand in hand with building densification and the creation of compact and vibrant station centers where individual motorized traffic (TIM) can be significantly reduced.\n\nThe federal strategy in this area is outlined in the Sectoral Transport Plan: the objectives are to ensure rural space accessibility and tourist region access, and to guarantee a minimal quality service for the resident population. Efficient links between the plain and the mountains contribute to preserving high-altitude villages as places of life and activity, and constitute a guarantee of the competitiveness of these regions. Furthermore, improving accessibility to these regions through public transport is a priority for the Confederation for the \"Western Alps\" space.\n\nGiven the various elements described above, the canton's desire to maintain and develop cable transport infrastructure fits perfectly within the federal strategy. In this context, it is up to the canton to define the spatial coordination framework aimed at maintaining and developing the cable transport infrastructure. It involves increasing the attractiveness of public transport links between the plain and the mountains, reducing problems related to TIM, and promoting the development of quality urbanization in tourist stations and high-altitude villages. The status of installation projects is listed in the annex.\n\nIt should be noted that specific infrastructures used for repetitive skiing within ski areas are treated in section B.4 \"Ski Areas\".\n\n### Coordination\n\n#### Principles\n\n1. Ensure the permanence of installations whose service is recognized as a public utility.\n2. Promote the realization of new installations where the need clause is demonstrated and environmental conditions are respected.\n3. Strengthen intermodality between cable link installations and other modes of transport.\n4"

    "### D.6 Cable Public Transport Infrastructures\n\n#### Follow-up Plan\n\n**The Canton:**\na) Considers the potential of cable transport installations within mobility network improvement projects;\nb) Periodically evaluates, in collaboration with the Federal Office of Transport (OFT), and compares with other public transport means, the relevance of cable transport offers in terms of technical and financial efficiency;\nc) Proposes new cable transport connections to analyze based on conditions to respect for coordinated coordination;\nd) Integrates relevant cable transport projects into cantonal planning and coordinates with federal competent authorities (information and preconsultation), and verifies the documents prepared by the applicant with these authorities;\ne) Coordinates with competent authorities the procedures for concession requests, approval plans, construction authorizations, and adequate zone planning.\n\n**Communes:**\na) Take into account existing cable transport installations in their territorial planning;\nb) Actively participate in the concrete implementation of the principles mentioned above;\nc) Delimitate the appropriate zones in their land allocation plans and reserve necessary alignments and spaces (e.g., tracks, stations, parking lots).\n\n#### Conditions to Respect for Coordinated Coordination\n\nNew cable transport installation projects must be classified in the category \"coordinated coordination\" before subsequent procedures for plan allocation, approval, and construction authorization initiation (public inquiry). They are classified in the \"coordinated coordination\" category when it is proven, through an explanatory report, that the project meets the following conditions:\nI. Public participation and spatial coordination at the municipal level, or intermunicipal, have been carried out;\nII. Justification of the need for potential transport demand is provided, notably good attractiveness of the region upstream, sufficient population, employment, or tourist basins;\nIII. The installation route and its location show optimal connection with the surrounding mobility networks, particularly good intermodal connectivity of the downstream station and fine non-priority service along the route;\nIV. Topography is favorable for cable transport and the technical feasibility of the project is demonstrated;\nV. Competitiveness against public transport and TIM is demonstrated;\nVI. Potential conflicts with land development, agriculture, forestry, environment (e.g., major risks, noise, water), nature and landscape protection (e.g., IFF, IVS, ISO, biotopes), geotechnical constraints, natural dangers, airspace, and third-party installations, notably power lines, have been identified, and nothing indicates that the project entails major conflicts."

    "This page appears to be part of a Swiss legal or regulatory document, specifically related to urban planning and building regulations. It discusses alignment rules, distances, and height calculations for buildings. Here's a detailed breakdown of the content:\n\n### Section 1: Alignments\n- **Article 9 (not fully visible):** Discusses fixed alignments along communication routes, conduits, natural and cultural objects. Procedures and determination of these alignments are governed by special legislation and municipal regulations.\n- **Article 10 (Réserve des législations spéciales):** States that distances and other free spaces defined in other legislations, particularly concerning fire protection, forests, or water protection, are reserved.\n- **Article 11 (Hauteur totale):** Defines total height as the greatest height between the highest point of the roof structure and the reference ground level measured at plumb. The reference ground level corresponds to the natural ground. If it cannot be determined due to previous excavations and fillings, the reference is the surrounding natural ground. For reasons related to land development or equipment, the reference ground level can be determined differently within a planning procedure. If the building is stepped or situated unevenly, the total height is individually defined for each part of the building. Superstructures do not count in the calculation of the total height.\n\n### Section 2: Excavation Height\n- **Article 12 (Hauteur d'excavation):** Defines excavation height as the difference in height between the natural ground and the lowest point of the developed terrain, extending beyond the total height. The Building Ordinance (OC) may specify, for specific cases, that the excavation height is not measured as an extension of the total height.\n\nThis document provides detailed guidelines for determining building heights and aligning structures according to specific regulations and planning procedures."

    "### A.14 Bisses\n\nThe cantonal inventory of bisses shows that the number of functioning bisses has significantly decreased over the 20th century (207 at the beginning, 120 at the end of the 20th century). Furthermore, many bisses have been closed and partially or completely put under pipe, mainly to ensure their operation and safety. The canton must demonstrate how it intends to protect and maintain the bisses, particularly those of cantonal and regional importance. It is therefore essential to actively include the bisses in the Valais territory reflections.\n\n#### Coordination\n\n##### Principles\n1. Encourage the conservation, restoration, and maintenance of open-air bisses while ensuring that, as much as possible, construction respects traditional methods and materials in accordance with cantonal directives, and does not interfere with their primary agricultural function.\n2. Value the tourism and leisure potential of the bisses, especially those related to mobility itineraries, while ensuring that this does not harm their cultural and heritage substance.\n3. Inventory and classify the bisses throughout the canton.\n4. Maintain a residual flow downstream of the bisses in operation to maintain aquatic biodiversity.\n\n##### Steps to Follow\nThe canton:\na) Supports municipalities in the maintenance or rehabilitation of bisses through improvements in agriculture (periodic state assessment (REP) or remediation);\nb) Keeps the cantonal inventory of bisses up-to-date and defines protection objectives;\nc) Verifies the classification of bisses by considering the rehabilitation works carried out;\nd) Resolves conflicts of use and water sharing, particularly downstream of water intakes during dry periods.\n\nMunicipalities:\na) Indicate the bisses located on their territory, taking into account the relevant cantonal inventory;\nb) Determine the bisses recognized as of cantonal and regional importance as objects of protection and set corresponding conditions in the municipal building and zoning regulations;\nc) Inform the Agricultural Service of any abandonment, remediation, or work or intervention on a bisse that could affect its traditional functioning.\n\n#### Documentation\nSDT, Bisses, 1993/1998/2002/2018\nAssociation Bisses du Valais, Bisses du Valais – Dossier de présentation en vue de l'inscription des bisses sur la liste indicative de l'UNESCO, 2016\nSCA, Directive – Assain"

    "### A.15 Lakeside Areas of Lake Geneva\n\nThe Federal Water and Migratory Birds of International and National Importance (OROEM) Zone is also classified as a Ramsar site (international wetland). The OROEM Zone was introduced in 2011 with the concept of reserved water space (ERE), aiming to provide rivers and water bodies with the necessary space to guarantee their natural functions, flood protection, and water use. Article 41b of the Ordinance specifies a minimum width of 15 meters for the ERE along the Valaisan shores of Lake Geneva. This width takes into account the balance of interests, particularly the issues related to river restoration. Specific maintenance measures must be implemented in this area to establish typical lakeside vegetation and ensure quiet zones for water birds and small terrestrial fauna.\n\nIn addition, within the framework of the third Rhône correction, the canton participates in the project to revitalize the Rhône mouth (creation of a delta), carried out by the Canton of Vaud, and collaborates with it to define the material extraction modalities.\n\n### Population Benefits Infrastructure\n\nNavigation on Lake Geneva presents a great interest for the served municipalities in terms of transport and tourism, and must therefore be maintained and reinforced. The creation of a new port at Bouveret, as well as the development of a multimodal exchange interface at the commune of St-Gingolph, is aligned with these reflections. These projects, as well as the development of habitat and aquatic activities (e.g., Swiss Vapeur Parc, Camping Rive Bleue, Aquaparc), require a comprehensive reflection to define the possibilities of tourism and residential development for the entire sector.\n\nThe lake shores are also very appreciated by hikers. On these sites, property rights are often considered acquired. It is therefore indispensable to ensure access to the shores by maintaining or developing riverside paths. At Bouveret, appropriate developments ensure public access to the shores, against only 20% of the approximately 3700 meters of shores on the commune of St-Gingolph.\n\nThe possibility of being able to develop a riverside pedestrian path is also foreseen in the plan of allocation of zones (PAZ) and the communal construction and zone regulation (RCCZ) of the communes of St-Gingolph and Port-Valais.\n\nGiven the various functions of the lake and its shores (ecological, economic, and social), the"
