It sets requirements for:\\n   - Thermal insulation against heat or cold.\\n   - Heat and sanitary hot water production installations.\\n   - Heat recovery.\\n   - Ventilation and cooling installations.\\n   - Heated swimming pools.\\n\\n### Section 5: Utilisation \\u00e9conome et efficace de l'\\u00e9nergie\\n\\n#### 5.1 Dispositions g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rales (General provisions)\\n\\nThis section outlines general principles for the economical and efficient use of energy, emphasizing the need to minimize energy consumption, use the most appropriate energy forms, invest minimally for high energy efficiency, and recover usable waste heat.\"]"
